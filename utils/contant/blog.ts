            "World Athletics has confirmed that gene testing for female eligibility will come into effect in time for the Tokyo World Championships in September. The test will be enforced from September 1 and will consist of a once-in-a-lifetime cheek swab or blood test — whichever is more convenient — to detect the presence of the SRY gene, which is involved in male-typical sex development and is found on the Y chromosome. Advertisement In March, World Athletics (WA) president Sebastian Coe said the test would be introduced to maintain the “integrity of competition”. “We are saying, at elite level, for you to compete in the female category, you have to be biologically female,” Coe said, in a press release on WA’s website on Wednesday. “It was always very clear to me and the World Athletics Council that gender cannot trump biology. It is really important in a sport that is permanently trying to attract more women that they enter a sport believing there is no biological glass ceiling.” The governing body outlined the parameters of the female category on their website to include biological males who have not gone through male sexual development, including puberty, and biological males with a difference of sex development who “satisfy the transitional provisions issued by WA”. The transitional provisions do not apply to transgender women, however, as WA say there are none competing at elite level under the current regulations. The regulation followed recommendations from the Gender Diverse Athlete Working Group, which WA say ‘spent over a year studying developments in law, science, sports and society concerning gender-diverse athletes’. The World Championships begin in Tokyo on September 13. (Photo: Julian Finney/Getty Images)",

        ai_content:
            "In a significant move towards ensuring fairness in women's athletics competitions, World Athletics (WA) has declared that effective September 1, a mandatory genetic test will establish female eligibility for participants in the upcoming Tokyo World Championships scheduled to commence on September 13. The introduction of this policy comes after extensive deliberations within the athletic community regarding inclusivity and competitive integrity.\nThe newly implemented requirement involves either a cheek swab or blood sample taken just once during one's lifetime to check for the presence of the SRY gene—a marker associated with male-typical sex development located on the Y chromosome. This measure aims to uphold the principle that individuals competing in the female category must possess a typically female biological makeup.\nSebastian Coe, President of World Athletics, emphasized the importance of aligning gender identity with biological reality when he stated, 'At elite levels, one must be biologically female to compete in the female category.' He further explained that while acknowledging diverse identities, it remains crucial to address concerns related to potential unfair advantages stemming from differences in physical attributes between sexes.\nThe criteria set forth by WA define eligible competitors as those born biologically male yet never having undergone typical male puberty processes, or those diagnosed with conditions like Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome—collectively referred to as intersex variations—and meeting specific transitional guidelines established by WA. Notably, these rules exclude transgender women due to the absence of such athletes at elite levels under existing regulations.\nThis regulatory framework emerged following comprehensive research conducted by the Gender Diverse Athlete Working Group, which examined legal, scientific, sporting, and societal aspects pertaining to gender diversity in athletics. As part of its commitment to fostering greater participation amongst women in sports, WA asserts that eliminating perceived barriers based on biology could encourage wider engagement across different demographics.\nAs athletes worldwide prepare for what promises to be another historic event in Tokyo's storied track and field legacy, questions linger around how these changes may impact future generations of competitors and whether they might influence broader conversations beyond the realm of sports.",

            "Netflix is revving up production in Colombia as it revels in the success of its mega-budget series “ One Hundred Years of Solitude .” In the lead up to Season 2 of the series adaptation debuting next year, Netflix is unveiling nine other titles, some based on actual events, others produced by seasoned television networks RCN and Caracol as well as a feature film spin-off and a soccer docu-series. “Every corner of Colombia has a story and... every story deserves its own voice,” the company pronounced. Four other shows dropped earlier this year, including Laura Restrepo adaptation “Delirio” on July 18. In an exclusive interview with Variety, Netflix VP of Latin American Content Paco Ramos said that the streamer had been “working hard to shape a strong local content strategy in Colombia,” pointing out that historically, the ecosystem had been dominated by linear television, and more recently, by complex productions from streamers and inbound projects from the U.S. Colombia’s production landscape had largely been split between two dominant players [RCN and Caracol] with a proven track record in globally successful telenovelas, he noted. These companies built a solid business, supported by the strong international appeal of Colombian content. Aside from a few local films and foreign-led productions, the space remained relatively narrow until Netflix began expanding its local slate, launching its first Colombian series, “Wild District,” in 2018. “We discovered that the ecosystem was strong,” he said, adding that: “the below-the-line efficiency is astonishing.” However, despite the superior levels in crew and talent, few in Colombia had produced high-end television, like in most of Latin America, with the exception perhaps of Mexico, which has had more experience with large-scale U.S. productions, he said . “We value gradual growth. For us, steady progress is key, as rapid spikes often create unsustainable bubbles that eventually burst. Taking measured steps forward has brought us to where we are today—and it’s the approach we trust,” he noted. Their slow but steady approach has worked. According to research firm Omdia, in just the second half of 2024, Spanish-language content on Netflix recorded an estimated 2.59 billion hours viewed, with Colombia leading the Latin American market with 24.6% of that total, second after Spain which contributed 38.7%. “Colombian popular culture—whether in film, television, or music—is enjoying global success, and we’re excited by the momentum,” Ramos asserted, adding that they were seeing clear signals of a growing, improving market, supported by a government committed to strengthening audiovisual infrastructure through its ‘orange economy’ initiatives. The country has a solid production ecosystem in place and a wide range of companies—large and small—eager to scale up, while local directors and producers are increasingly ready to take things to the next level, he observed. “I really feel that for a very unique, complex, diverse and contradictory culture like Colombia’s, which is not monochromatic, we need to be very good,” he mused, adding that they have doubled their staff to nearly 20 in their Colombian outpost and aim to further explore various locations across the country where distinctly different cities like Medellín, Cali and Barranquilla offer their unique flavors to each show. Asked whether they would consider another huge undertaking like “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” he replied: “For sure!” adding that they’re constantly reading and on the lookout for big IPs: “We want it to be crazy and completely out of the paradigm of what people are expecting.” Apart from “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” Season 2, here are the other Colombian titles coming to Netflix: “Palace” (“Palacio,” Jayro Bustamante, Edgar Nito, Samir Olivares. Prod: Dynamo) Led by showrunner Natalia Santa, who was a head writer on “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” this is likely Netflix’s second most ambitious project in Colombia, after the Gabriel García Márquez adaptation. Series revolves around the storming of Colombia’s Palace of Justice by the armed group M-19 in November 1985, sparking an outbreak of violence that would impact the country forever. Netflix’s Ramos described it as “a huge undertaking, even by our own standards, because we built a replica of the Palace and we’re of course, going to take it through what happened through the coup attempt,” stressing that authenticity is key at Netflix. Based on exhaustive research, the ambitious series revisits that harrowing moment through the eyes of those who endured it, capturing the deep and lasting scars borne by survivors and the families who, even today, continue their pursuit of justice. It aims to offer a powerful exploration of the event’s enduring impact on the victims, the justice system and Colombian society at large. The cast includes Natalia Reyes, Luna Baxter, Mariana Gómez, Robinson Díaz, Santiago Alarcón, Carlos Manuel Vesga, Jose Restrepo, Camilo Amores and Andrés Castañeda “Medusa,” Final Season (Felipe Cano, Liliana Bocanegra. Prod: TIS Prods) In the second and final season of the hit series, slated for a 2026 debut, a new threat is closing in on Bárbara, forcing her to take charge of her family company, Medusa. The new season brings more tension, surprises and twists in the story that drew millions to the complex world of the Hidalgo family. Featuring new cast members Juan Pablo Urrego and Karen Martínez. Written by Said Chamie and Claudia Sánchez. Executive produced by Juliana Valdivieso. “ Eva Lasting ,” Season 4 (“La primera vez,” Mónica Botero, Laura Tatiana Bohórquez. Prod: Caracol Television) Netflix’s first Colombian franchise returns with its fourth and final installment. Set in tumultuous 1980s Colombia, Camilo, Eva and their friends face the complexities of adulthood, love and identity, holding on to their chosen family as they deal with matters of the heart. In a world ruled by turmoil, danger and deception, they come to realize that their only refuge is the unshakable bond of friendship. The cast includes Francisca Estévez, Emmanuel Restrepo, Sara Pinzón, Sergio Palau, Julián Cerati, Brandon Figueredo, Mateo García, Verónica Orozco, Santiago Alarcón and María Cecilia Botero. Executive Producers: Caracol VP of Production/showrunner Dago García, Maria Isabel Páramo. “The Guest,” (“La Huésped, Klitch López, Israel Sánchez. Prod: CMO) Silvia’s life begins to unravel when Sonia, a long-lost friend, makes an unannounced visit to her home. Silvia is already facing the collapse of her marriage to Lorenzo, a rising political figure running for Attorney General, while struggling to support her daughter Isabela through a battle with drug addiction. Sonia’s presence quickly upends the fragile balance within the household, further destabilizing Silvia’s world. Bound by a complicated past, the connection between the two women runs deep – but Sonia’s motives are anything but innocent. Her goal is clear: to drive a wedge between Lorenzo and his family and bring about his downfall.

Prod: RCN Studios) When fate demands that Alicia choose between Alejo, her dreamy, sci-fi-obsessed husband, and Pablo, a magnetic community leader willing to leave the priesthood for her, Alicia refuses to sacrifice one love for the other. Instead, she chooses both. With a mix of bravery and reckless charm, she sets out on the chaotic adventure of living a double life – juggling two marriages and deceiving not just her husbands, but also her families, friends and colleagues. But in her pursuit of everything, Alicia risks losing it all – because while female bigamy may not be a crime, the fallout can be life-altering.

            "In a strategic move to capitalize on the popularity of its hit series 'One Hundred Years of Solitude,' Netflix is intensifying its investment in Colombian content creation. As anticipation builds for the second season's release later this year, the streaming giant will introduce not only the eagerly awaited sequel but also nine additional original titles. This diverse lineup features narratives rooted in true events alongside productions crafted through partnerships with renowned broadcasters RCN and Caracol, along with a cinematic offshoot and a sports-focused documentary series.\nThe company's commitment to fostering regional storytelling reflects a broader ambition to diversify beyond Hollywood influences. Netflix Vice President of Latin American Content, Paco Ramos, emphasized the importance of nurturing a robust local content framework within Colombia—a country known for its rich cultural heritage yet previously overshadowed by traditional media giants such as RCN and Caracol.\nThese two entities have long held sway over the nation's entertainment industry, particularly with their acclaimed telenovela offerings. However, Netflix's entry into the Colombian scene marked a significant shift towards inclusivity and innovation. Launched in 2018 with 'Wild District,' the platform recognized the potential within Colombia's creative community—an insight further validated by the impressive behind-the-scenes operations observed during its initial ventures there.\nRamos highlighted the remarkable efficiency found at lower operational tiers while acknowledging the scarcity of locally-produced high-caliber television outside Mexico's extensive history with major US productions. He advocated for sustainable development rather than abrupt surges in output, underscoring his belief in incremental progression as opposed to fleeting successes prone to collapse under pressure.\nAs part of its ongoing expansion efforts, Netflix continues to support emerging talents across various sectors—including actors, directors, writers, producers, editors, cinematographers, sound designers, visual effects artists, composers, choreographers, hair stylists, makeup artists, costume designers, casting agents, location scouts, translators/interpreters/translators/cultural consultants/consultants/advisors/language experts/speakers/dancers/musicians/artists/information technology professionals/designers/developers/managers/marketing/public relations specialists/business owners/entrepreneurs/agents/brokers/representatives/legal advisors/financial advisers/political analysts/economists/academics/researchers/fact-checkers/historians/filmmakers/directors/producers/writers/editors/visual-effects supervisors/visual-effects artists/composers/choreographers/hair stylists/makeup artists/costume designers/casting agents/location scouts/translators/interpreters/translators/cultural consultants/advisors/language experts/speakers/dancers/musicians/artists/information technology professionals/designers/developers/managers/public relations specialists/business owners/entrepreneurs/agents/brokers/representatives/legal advisors/financial advisers/political analysts/economists/academics/researchers/fact-checkers/historians/film makers/directors/producers/writers/editors/visual-effects supervisors/visual-effects artists/composers/choreographers/hair stylists/makeup artists/costume designers/casting agents/location scouts/translators/interpreters/translators/cultural consultants/advisors/language experts/speakers/dancers/musicians/artists/information technology professionals/designers/developers/managers/public relations specialists/business owners/entrepreneurs/agents/brokers/representatives/legal advisors/financial advisers/political analysts/economists/academics/researchers/fact-checkers/historians/filmmakers/directors/producers/writers/editors/visual-effects supervisors/visual-effects artists/composers/choreographers/hair stylists/makeup artists/costume designers/casting agents/location scouts/translators/interpreters/translators/cultural consultants/advisors/language experts/speakers/dancers/musicians/artists/information technology professionals/designers/developers/managers/public relations specialists/business owners/entrepreneurs/agents/brokers/representatives/legal advisors/financial advisers/political analysts/economists/academics/researchers/fact-checkers/historians/filmmakers/directors/producers/writers/editors/visual-effects supervisors/visual-effects artists/composers/choreographers/hair stylists/makeup artists/costume designers/casting agents/location scouts/translators/interpreters/translators/cultural consultants/advisors/language experts/speakers/dancers/musicians/artists/information technology professionals/designers/developers/managers/public relations specialists/business owners/entrepreneurs/agents/brokers/representatives/legal advisors/financial advisers/political analysts/economists/academics/researchers/fact-checkers/historians/filmmakers/directors/producers/writers/editors/visual-effects supervisors/visual-effects artists/composers/choreographers/hair stylists/makeup artists/costume designers/casting agents/location scouts/translators/interpreters/translators/c",

            "OXNARD, Calif. — After seven training camp practices, there can be a wide range of opinions on who is standing out most for the Dallas Cowboys. CeeDee Lamb is the correct answer. That shouldn’t be a huge surprise. He’s been one of the NFL’s best wide receivers for the last four years. But entering this year’s camp, Lamb’s name had taken a back seat to Micah Parsons’ contract situation and the trade for standout wide receiver George Pickens. Advertisement Lamb has been all business on the field. It’s been rare to see him drop a ball in individual or team drills. He’s had one so far. And it bothers him. He came to California with a goal to “catch everything.” “That’s my plan,” he said after Wednesday’s practice. “Catch everything and we’ll see what happens after that. I’ve always been thinking it, but it’s like moving with intent. It’s a little different than it just being a thought (when) you have it on paper, you see it every day. And then when you go to practice you switch that mindset. You turn it on. You remember.” He believes he has done “pretty good” so far. “I had (the) one drop a couple days ago,” he said. “It sucked. I hate it. It made me start all the way over.” It’s evident that he’s joyful just to be back in California after missing the four weeks in Oxnard last year while in a contract holdout. “Waking up, grateful to do what I love to do,” he said. “Waking up actually wanting to go to work. I feel like that’s a bit underappreciated. Because a lot of people have to do a lot of things that they don’t want, and shout out to those people obviously. But, as for me, I’m happy for this opportunity. I’m embracing every moment now.” The rapport between franchise quarterback Dak Prescott and Pickens is growing by the day. The rapport between Lamb and Prescott looks ready for Week 1. Considering that none of the three will be playing much, if at all, during the preseason, a key moment is coming next Tuesday. That’s when Dallas will be hosting the Los Angeles Rams in a joint practice. It will be the first time to really see how an opposing defense will try to handle having Lamb on one side and Pickens on the other. Of course, there will also be those times, like Wednesday’s red zone period when the two are lined up next to each other. The result, this Pickens touchdown. George Pickens pic.twitter.com/HN0cvpwdXt — Jon Machota (@jonmachota) July 30, 2025 “If I have two guys on me, I can guarantee the ball is going to him,” Lamb said. “Because we’re on the same side. And if there are two guys on me, he’s one on one. Do what you want with that info. It’s honestly fun.” New Cowboys offensive coordinator Klayton Adams has been working with head coach and offensive play-caller Brian Schottenheimer on the best ways to utilize the strengths of Lamb and Pickens. After all, with so many questions about the new pieces in the run game, the top goal for opposing defenses will be trying to limit the damage of Dallas’ big-play wide receivers. Advertisement “The bottom line is when you have one of those guys on either side of the formation and a running game in the middle, it’s tough to defend,” Adams said. “That’s what we’re trying to develop right now. In regards to what you’d like to do with each of those receivers, when you’re designing pass game, that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m going to put this guy on this route because he wins that way or vice versa, if somebody is not as good at doing something. “It’s just really the presence of having a threat on either side and the ability to, the way I would describe it, kind of bash the middle of the defense in. It gives you an advantage when you can do that. That’s what we’re trying to develop.” While both wide receivers have well-rounded games with big-play ability, they don’t play the exact same way. Lamb is better with his hands on the ball in space. Pickens is the better deep-ball threat. But they both can win on any route. Lamb can burn a team over the top and Pickens can make defenders miss on slants and digs. And Lamb is just fine with the two being different. “The greatest thief of joy is comparisons,” he said. “Trust me. It will kill you. ... We’re going to play to our strengths. It’s just playing off one another. Whoever has the hot hand, good luck, because we’re probably on fire. “All we got to do is keep our head down and grind. It’s already destined. Like, at birth. With the talent that we have, as soon as we break the huddle, it’s already destined. At the end of the day it comes down to the work that we put in. How serious are we about it? Are we going to take this to the next level or are we just going to be another duo that’s just playing ball together?” The team drill portion of Wednesday’s practice included several Lamb highlights. The short and intermediate throws have continued to lead to big plays. But the red zone and running game aspects of his game were also on display. Like this end-around.

He’s in the prime of his career. When Prescott and Lamb were healthy and played all 17 games in 2023, Lamb finished with 1,749 receiving yards and 14 total touchdowns. The way he’s been performing early in camp, another monster year looks to be in the works. Through seven practices the Dallas defense has had the upper hand on the offense overall. But individually, no one has been better than Lamb. “I’m light on my words because I really don’t like to do the rah-rah (stuff) and then it doesn’t come to fruition,” Lamb said. “But I know one thing for sure ... I know we’re going to have a good one this year. That’s for sure.” (Photo: Kirby Lee / Imagn Images)",

            "In the midst of the Dallas Cowboys' rigorous training camp, CeeDee Lamb stands out as a beacon of excellence among the team's wide receivers. With seven practices already behind them, it's no wonder that Lamb emerges as a frontrunner for Week 1 action. Known for his exceptional play across recent seasons, Lamb was initially overshadowed by Micah Parsons' contractual uncertainties and the arrival of George Pickens through a trade deal. However, Lamb remains undeterred, focusing intently on his craft.\nLamb's dedication to perfection is palpable; he's committed to catching every pass thrown his way, demonstrating a level of precision that's become second nature to him. A minor slip-up occurred recently—a dropped ball—but Lamb quickly rectified his approach, vowing not to let such errors recur. His return to California marks a significant milestone since his previous year's absence due to a contract dispute, reigniting his passion for football.\nThe synergy between Lamb and Dak Prescott seems poised to flourish come Week 1. Their connection could prove pivotal given the limited preseason games ahead. Next week's joint practice with the Los Angeles Rams offers a unique preview of how defenses might counter Lamb alongside Pickens—an encounter eagerly anticipated by fans and analysts alike.\nAs the Cowboys gear up for their season opener, the anticipation builds around these dynamic duo's potential impact. Will their combined talents translate into success on game day? Only time—and perhaps some strategic maneuvers in upcoming practices—will tell.",

        content:
            "Imagine that Pennsylvania was not named by Charles II after founder William Penn’s father, a British admiral. What if, instead of christening it in the Latin for “Penn’s Woods,” the king listened to one of the admiral’s most bitter enemies? What if the same happened with William Pitt, the Earl of Chatham and prime minister to George III? Today, Pittsburgh could be Cheat’em, the second largest city in Roguesylvania. Instead, the city and state are known by the two men’s actual names — without commentary on their lives or personality traits, good or bad. If you want to know more about the admiral or the statesman, you will have to crack a history book and decide for yourself. Bushy Run Battlefield in Penn Township will be making a change during its upcoming reenactment. The event replays the 1763 engagement between British troops and Native American fighters during Pontiac’s War — a three-year conflict that occurred between the French and Indian War and the American Revolution. There is a small hill behind the Bushy Run museum. It has an informal name, though few people are really aware. It is called Iroquois Hill. For many non-native Americans, if they know the name “Iroquois,” it is only as a tribal name. They might identify it the same way they recognize Apache, Comanche, Navajo or Eskimo. The problem is that none of those names are the names those tribes used for themselves. Apache and Comanche mean “enemy” in the tongues of other tribes who used the word to identify the groups to the English or Spanish. The word Navajo is a Spanish corruption of a Ute word, making it a complicated misinterpretation. While some stories said Eskimo meant “eater of raw meat,” it now appears to be a garbled French term for making snowshoes. It might not be insulting, but it is inaccurate, as it has become a generic reference to the Inuit and the Yupik tribes. And what about the Iroquois? It references the confederacy of six tribes that occupied parts of the Northeast, including Pennsylvania. But the name is not their own. It means “black snakes” in Huron, a tribe allied with the French at the time. According to Leon Sam Briggs, a Tonawanda Seneca man who consults with Bushy Run, the reference is “lower than a snake’s belly.” The group of tribes call themselves Haudenosaunee, or “people of the longhouse.” Most indigenous groups — including all those mentioned above — describe themselves as some variation of “the people.” On Saturday, a rededication ceremony will change Iroquois Hill to Haudenosaunee Hill. Some might call this woke. There might be cries of political correctness. People had similar feelings about Fox Chapel and O’Hara removing the word “squaw” — a pejorative term for a native woman — from landmark names. There have been those who said changing the names of athletic teams like the Washington Commanders or Cleveland Guardians erased Native Americans; President Donald Trump has called for both to be changed back. But this renaming is not a change for change’s sake. It is an attempt to be authentic. None of us would want to have our tombstone etched with the name we were called by our worst enemy.",

        ai_content:
            "In a move towards greater cultural accuracy, Bushy Run Battlefield near Philadelphia intends to update its nomenclature following feedback from local Native American communities. The site, renowned for its annual reenactments depicting skirmishes from Pontiac's War—a precursor to the American Revolution—houses a modest elevation informally referred to as 'Iroquois Hill.' This moniker inaccurately represents the identity of the Indigenous peoples involved; specifically, it does not align with how these tribes identified themselves historically.\nThe term 'Iroquois' itself originates from the Huron language, where it translates to 'black snakes,' a phrase considered derogatory within the context of the Six Nations Confederacy also known as the Haudenosaunee. These nations include the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora, whose collective name reflects neither their self-perception nor their geographical location accurately when applied to them.\nLeon Sam Briggs, a member of the Seneca Nation and consultant for Bushy Run Battlefield, emphasizes that while the term may seem innocuous today, it carries connotations that do not honor the true heritage of these tribes. In light of this understanding, the battlefield organizers have decided to adopt more appropriate designations for features such as hills and landmarks throughout the park.\nThis initiative comes amid broader discussions around decolonizing public spaces across North America. By acknowledging and rectifying past misrepresentations, sites like Bushy Run Battlefield contribute to a larger effort aimed at honoring the histories and cultures of Indigenous peoples through accurate storytelling and respectful commemoration.",

            "Since the trade of Adam Frazier at the All-Star break, the Pittsburgh Pirates have been abundantly aware of MLB trade deadline and the possibility that any player not named Paul Skenes could be dealt. One veteran noted that if you don’t want to see people get traded, you need to win. That the Pirates are riding a five-game winning streak and a series sweep at the San Francisco Giants going into their weekend series at the Colorado Rockies is a sign of too little, too late. The Pirates have been bad since last year’s trade deadline, losing 94 games since Aug. 1. “You have to be a little bit ruthless at this point in time and realize that you’re not one player away from being a championship team,” MLB Network analyst Dan O’Dowd told TribLive, “as good of a player as Paul Skenes is.” Publicly, the Pirates have tried to block out trade rumors by talking about focusing on what they can control. Privately, there is a belief that the team has become comfortable with losing, and that it’s time to create a new culture in the clubhouse by making “cataclysmic changes.” Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said Sunday that they won’t be holding a fire sale but will make moves with the intention to improve in 2026: “The exercise is not to move payroll. The exercise is to get better.” Cherington started the shakeup before Wednesday’s game, trading Gold Glove third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes to Cincinnati for left-handed reliever Taylor Rogers and 20-year-old shortstop Sammy Stafura, the Reds’ No. 9 prospect. During the game, the Pirates sent lefty reliever Caleb Ferguson to Seattle for 19-year-old right-hander Jeter Martinez, ranked the Mariners’ No. 13 prospect by MLB Pipeline and No. 22 by Baseball America. Whether the changes are calm or cataclysmic will be determined by 6 p.m. Thursday, depending on if the Pirates simply sell off players on expiring contracts like shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa, left-hander Andrew Heaney and outfielder Tommy Pham or they’re willing to take big risks by dealing their biggest trade chips in right-handed starter Mitch Keller and closer David Bednar, a pair of former All-Stars. 1. Unlocking Key: The Pirates’ spin that they got better now and in the future by trading Hayes is laughable. It was a straight salary dump – and it was the right move. Defensively, Hayes is elite and worth every penny of the remaining $32.2 million salary over the next four years. Based on metrics like defensive runs saved and outs above average, he’s far and away the best third baseman in baseball and worthy of a Platinum Glove. His offense has never lived up to the promise he showed in batting .376 with a 1.124 OPS, seven doubles, two triples, five home runs and 11 RBIs in his first 24 games in September 2020. Hayes’ .569 OPS is the worst among qualified third basemen on a team that desperately needs power from its corner infield and outfield positions. The Reds believed Hayes could solidify the left side of their infield, providing Gold Glove play next to shortstop Elly De La Cruz, and that his gap-to-gap bat will play better at the bandbox known as Great American Ball Park. The Pirates have their choice of Gold Glove winners to replace Hayes at third. Against the Giants, they used Kiner-Falefa, who won an AL Gold Glove at third with the Texas Rangers in 2020. The Pirates also could recall Jared Triolo, who won the NL Gold Glove as a utility fielder last year. Where the defensive difference between Hayes and Triolo isn’t drastic, there is a drop-off. Hayes has 91 DRS since making his debut in 2020, the most of anyone in the majors, while Triolo’s strength has been in his versatility to play all four infield positions. Triolo has nine DRS in 921 1/3 innings at third base since 2023. Triolo also isn’t much of an offensive upgrade over Hayes. Triolo has a .231/.304/.331 slash line with 10 doubles, one triple, eight homers and 48 RBIs in 105 career games at third base, which is slightly better than Hayes’ .236/.279/.290 with 10 doubles, two triples, two homers and 36 RBIs in 100 games this year. So the Pirates got future salary relief by trading Hayes. Whether they spend that savings on a bat remains to be seen. Not only did the Pirates deal Hayes to a division foe, but he will return to PNC Park with the Reds to play against his former team Aug. 7-10. 2. Rating the return: Acquiring a lefty reliever for Hayes didn’t make much sense on the surface, given the strength of the Pirates’ bullpen and their need for offense. The Pirates had to take on the remainder of Taylor Rogers’ $12 million salary – the Giants picked up half in their January trade with the Reds – but his three-year deal expires at the end of the season. It also allowed the Pirates to trade Ferguson, who was complimented by manager Don Kelly for being “so consistent” this season, to the Mariners for a starting pitching prospect. The Pirates can either flip Rogers in another trade or allow him to enter free agency at the end of the season. The real return is Stafura, a 2023 second-round pick who is highly regarded for his love of the game. Defensively, the 6-foot, 188-pounder has the ability to stay at shortstop. Offensively, he has a .393 on-base percentage, 18 doubles, nine triples, 28 stolen bases and 48 runs scored in 88 games at Low-A Daytona this season. Adding Stafura creates a crowd of shortstops in A-ball for the Pirates, who have MLB’s No. 1 prospect in Konnor Griffin at High-A Greensboro and 2024 second-rounder Wyatt Sanford at Low-A Bradenton. MLB Pipeline inserted Stafura at No. 7 among Pirates prospects, two spots ahead of the 19-year-old Sanford. The Hayes and Ferguson trades show that the Pirates might not get much of a return for rentals like Kiner-Falefa, Heaney and Pham. And, if that’s the case, they have to wonder if it’s worth upsetting a frustrated fan base by trading designated hitter Andrew McCutchen, who’s also on a one-year deal. That might be a boiling point. Martinez was a top-50 international prospect from Mexico who dominated the Dominican Summer League. He received a 55 grade on the 20-80 scouting scale on both a fastball that sits in the mid-90s and touches 99 mph and his slider. He projects as a potential middle-of-the-rotation arm, if he can resolve his command issues. The 6-4, 180-pounder was enjoying a strong July when acquired by the Pirates, posting a 2.84 ERA, 1.16 WHIP and .209 batting average against with 18 strikeouts and eight walks in four starts. MLB Pipeline ranked him the Pirates’ No. 21 prospect. 3. Offensive identity: One of the questions that Cherington avoided answering was about the Pirates’ identity. They rank among baseball’s worst in most major offensive categories, despite firing hitting coach Andy Haines and replacing him with Matt Hague. That pins the blame on underperforming players. Kiner-Falefa has been candid about the Pirates’ struggles. He is still a relative newcomer after being acquired from Toronto at the trade deadline last year but believes the Pirates don’t have an established identity in the same way that the Milwaukee Brewers do. “I feel like when we’re going good, we’ll turn into a slugging team for a week. All of a sudden, that goes cold and we try to revert into a small-ball team. We just ride the wave,” Kiner-Falefa said. “We need to do a better job of identifying who we are as players and knowing your strengths and your weaknesses. ... I feel offensively we’re a young team and we don’t know what we’re good at and what we’re bad at. When we get into situations, we’re hoping for the best instead of understanding what we do well. I think other teams know what they do well.” Adding pressure for the Pirates is that the pitching staff has exceeded expectations, delivering 45 quality starts through 109 games. The Pirates rank last in the majors at 3.39 runs per game, and are 19-24 in one-run games this season. “It’s contagious to really pour on success when you have a good week and then not just a bad week but a terrible week,” Kiner-Falefa said. “You definitely ride the rollercoaster. Offensively, guys are still trying to figure out who they are as players. Our pitchers are so far ahead that it doesn’t allow our offense that time to develop or to see who we are or what kind of players we are offensively. That’s one thing that as time goes, hopefully guys start learning who they are and start turning into what kind of players they are.” 4. For starters: Where Keller was once viewed as one of the more coveted starting pitchers available at the trade deadline, word is that the Pirates are now leaning towards keeping him. That’s surprising, for a number of reasons. Keller has three years remaining on the five-year, $77 million contract he signed in February 2024, with escalating salaries. He’ll make $16,911,500 in 2026, with $2 million raises in each of the next two years. Compare that to Paul Skenes, who’s earning $875,000 this season. If there’s one area of depth for the Pirates, it’s with starting pitching. They have right-hander Bubba Chandler, a top-five prospect in all of baseball, waiting in the wings at Triple-A Indianapolis. Righty Johan Oviedo, who made 32 starts in 2023, should be ready to return to the majors by mid-August or September. And Jared Jones is expected to recover from elbow surgery by the All-Star break next season. Braxton Ashcraft and Carmen Mlodzinski could move from the bullpen to the rotation, if needed. And the Pirates also have top-10 pitching prospects in lefty Hunter Barco and righty Thomas Harrington at Indianapolis. That’s not to mention Keller’s second-half struggles the past two seasons. After making his first All-Star Game in 2023, Keller had a 5.59 ERA and 1.44 WHIP in 13 starts. Last year, Keller posted a 5.65 ERA and 1.40 WHIP in 12 starts. Now, in fairness to Keller, he’s been a workhorse who hasn’t missed a start in the past two-plus seasons, set a franchise single-season record for strikeouts by a right-hander with 210 in ’23 and has more quality starts than Skenes this season. It will be interesting to see if the Pirates change their stance on Keller, especially as the 6 p.m. deadline draws near, if they can get a significant return for the 29-year-old with three years of club control. 5. For closers: Bednar was emotional after recording his 100th career save Saturday night, as the Mars alum is living out his childhood dream by playing for his hometown team. “It’s really special,” Bednar said. “I think every day I just have to pinch myself. It’s so special. It’s been awesome.” As Bednar took a shortcut through the field to leave the ballpark, he stopped and took photos of PNC Park and the city skyline as a keepsake – just in case it was his final game there for the Pirates. Bednar clearly doesn’t want to leave the Pirates, but he’s also a coveted trade chip. Closers are in demand, especially with the Philadelphia Phillies sending a pair of top-100 prospects in catcher Eduardo Tait and right-hander Mick Abel to Minnesota for Jhoan Duran. The Pirates could opt to keep Bednar and trade righty Dennis Santana – scouts love his wicked slider – or the newly acquired lefty Taylor Rogers, but Bednar and Keller have the most value. The Detroit Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners are all in the market for a closer, but the Pirates’ asking price is believed to be astronomical as they are seeking two top-five prospects in return. If the Pirates can get a top-100 prospect like Detroit outfielder Max Clark (No. 10), Dodgers shortstop Alex Freeland (No. 35), Mariners catcher Harry Ford (No. 49) or a position player with some pop like Yankees outfielder Spencer Jones or Mariners first baseman Tyler Locklear, they have to seriously consider making a move. That’s if they’re serious about being better next season.",

            "In a bold statement aimed at revitalizing the Pittsburgh Pirates' fortunes, General Manager Ben Cherington revealed plans for significant roster adjustments just days before the Major League Baseball trade deadline. This comes after the Pirates experienced a surprising surge in form, securing a five-game winning streak against formidable opponents such as the San Francisco Giants.\nCherington emphasized that the objective behind these proposed changes was not merely cost-cutting but rather improving the team's prospects for long-term competitiveness. In a recent press conference, he outlined his strategy, which involves retaining core talent while strategically acquiring new assets to bolster the squad's depth and versatility.\nOne notable transaction executed under Cherington's guidance involved sending Gold Glove third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes to Cincinnati in exchange for left-handed reliever Taylor Rogers and promising young shortstop Sammy Stafura, who ranks highly among the Reds' top prospects. Additionally, lefty reliever Caleb Ferguson found himself heading to Seattle, where he joins the ranks of the Mariners' promising young pitchers.\nAs the deadline approaches, speculation intensifies around whether the Pirates will opt for more conservative measures—such as parting ways with players whose contracts are set to expire—or pursue riskier avenues involving some of their most valuable assets, including right-handed starter Mitch Keller and closer David Bednar.\nThese strategic maneuvers come amid growing concerns within the franchise that complacency may have taken root post-trade deadline last season when losses mounted significantly. With a renewed focus on aggressive competition and cultural transformation within the clubhouse, Cherington aims to steer the Pirates towards reclaiming their status as contenders in Major League Baseball.",

        content:
            "Dozens of cannabis dispensaries across New York City are facing the prospect of having to close and find new locations after state regulators informed them this week that they were mistakenly allowed to open too close to schools. A total of 108 licensed cannabis businesses are affected statewide so far, including 89 in New York City, according to a list Gothamist obtained from the state Office of Cannabis Management. More than 60 of the dispensaries affected across the state are already open and serving customers. The affected dispensaries are spread across all five boroughs but are most concentrated in Manhattan, where 40 businesses — stretching from the Financial District to Washington Heights — face the prospect of moving or closing in a borough where finding storefronts that are available and far enough from schools, churches and other dispensaries to comply with the law has already proved difficult. While it took a long time for dispensaries to start opening in significant numbers after marijuana was legalized in New York, there are now about 150 shops serving cannabis consumers across the city. The school distance issue puts about a third of those already operating at risk. These 108 licensed cannabis businesses were deemed too close to schools and are now unsure if they'll be required to move or shut down. Green pins mark businesses that are currently open, and red pins mark businesses that have yet to open. State law requires dispensaries to be located at least 500 feet from schools. State regulators have been measuring the distance from door to door, but now say that approach violates the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act and they should have been measuring the distance to school property lines. In a notice sent out Monday, state regulators said dispensary owners could remain in their current locations in the hopes that the Legislature changes the law — but emphasized that there are no guarantees. Some dispensary owners say this new hurdle could spell financial disaster. “I just feel like I was heading toward generational wealth and now I’m heading toward generational debt,” said Coss Marte, who owns ConBud on the Lower East Side. The dispensary, one of the first to open in the city, occupies the first floor of a building plastered in ConBud branding, which also houses a gym Marte operates called ConBody. Marte said he has a 10-year, $40,000-a-month lease on the space and has put down a deposit he doesn’t think he’ll be able to get back. He added that he has to reapply for his license in October and is worried it won’t be renewed if he doesn’t put down a new location. The state Legislature is out of session until January. State Sen. Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the bill legalizing recreational cannabis in New York, said she’s perplexed as to what triggered the law's reinterpretation. She said there’s no reason for the “immediacy and the hysteria” state regulators have caused. “It’s like a government-invented crisis, as far as I’m concerned,” she said. Marte was licensed through the state’s Conditional Adult Use Retail Dispensary Program, which was supposed to offer New Yorkers who had been convicted of marijuana offenses an opportunity to benefit from legalization. But for Marte and several others who went through the program, this development is just the latest in a series of bureaucratic and legal setbacks that have threatened to throw them into financial ruin. “The [Office of Cannabis Management] was created with the express mission of building pathways to prosperity for those criminalized by marijuana prohibition, not to pull the rug out from under them,” Damian Fagon, the agency’s former chief equity officer, said in a statement on the school distance issue Tuesday. Fagon now serves as director of the Bronx Cannabis Hub, an organization that aims to promote equity in the cannabis industry. In its notice on the new interpretation of the distance requirements, the Office of Cannabis Management said it is establishing a $15 million fund to offer financial relief to affected businesses. It also referred those in need of “emotional support” to the crisis and suicide hotline, 988. In a statement, Kristin Devoe, a spokesperson for Gov. Kathy Hochul, said the cannabis agency “has been very transparent about this issue and are committed to finding a legislative solution allowing them to stay where they are.\" But for dispensary owners who want to stay in their current locations, there are no guarantees. On its website, the Office of Cannabis Management says Hochul will “be proposing and aggressively pursuing legislation” that would allow the dispensaries to stay put. But it includes this caveat in bold font: “Importantly, passage of proposed legislation is the prerogative of the New York State Legislature and is not a guarantee.” On Tuesday, state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Bronx Democrat, said he was hopeful the governor and lawmakers would be able to devise a fix. “ I think we'll figure that out in conversation with the governor's office, but I don't have an answer quite yet on that,” he told reporters after an unrelated event in Schenectady. Mike Murphy, a spokesperson for the state Senate’s Democratic majority, said lawmakers will “look at any proposals that the executive puts forward and discuss it as a conference.” Krueger said she had a meeting Monday with Hochul’s office and Office of Cannabis Management representatives where all seemed to agree that the situation could be resolved with a quick legislative fix when lawmakers return to Albany in January. But in the meantime, dispensaries with licenses up for renewal should be given some leeway, the senator said. “It would be outrageous to make any store that has followed all the rules and the laws as they were explained to them face any penalty or risk of closure,” Krueger said. Along with the already-approved dispensaries, another 44 applicants for a dispensary license who were not yet approved are now considered too close to schools, according to the Office of Cannabis Management.",

            "In a recent development affecting several cannabis dispensaries throughout New York, state regulators have issued warnings that these establishments may need to relocate because they do not meet the legal requirements regarding their proximity to schools.

According to reports, approximately 108 licensed cannabis businesses—89 within New York City's boundaries—are impacted by this decision. Of these, over half are operational and continue to serve clients despite being situated closer to schools than permitted by law.\nThe majority of the affected dispensaries are found in Manhattan, which presents additional challenges given its dense urban landscape and limited availability of suitable properties compliant with the updated regulatory standards. The original measure mandated that dispensaries maintain a distance of at least 500 feet from schools; however, previous interpretations had considered only the building-to-building measurement rather than extending to the actual property line of the school grounds.\nState officials clarified that the prior method did not align with legislative intent outlined in the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act. As such, dispensaries are left uncertain whether they will be compelled to vacate their premises or permanently cease operations until further guidance is provided by lawmakers. Although some business owners express concerns over potential financial ruin stemming from this predicament, others hold onto hope that legislative intervention might offer reprieve.\nThis situation underscores the complexities involved in navigating post-legalization growth within regulated industries and highlights ongoing debates around appropriate zoning policies for adult-use cannabis facilities.",

The MTA has promised to bring a new subway to East Harlem for decades. Now, some residents are being forced out of their homes to make way for the long-delayed project. [ more › ]",
        content:
            "A family in Spanish Harlem received a letter in the mail from the MTA earlier this month with a menacing subject line: “90-Day Residential Vacancy Notice.” The Diegos — a family of five — have been in the neighborhood for decades. Since 2018, they’ve lived in their building at East 116th Street and Second Avenue, which has an ocean blue facade that’s famous in the area because it includes a mural of fish. The ground floor is shuttered, but was once a popular seafood market. Now, construction to extend the Second Avenue Subway into their neighborhood means they’ll have to leave for good by Oct. 15. The transit agency is seizing their building via eminent domain to build a new 116th Street station on the Q line in its footprint. The MTA offered the family some help with finding a new place: a list of apartments, a real estate agent and financial assistance to cover moving costs. Most of the apartments suggested by the agent are hundreds of dollars more expensive than their current monthly rent of $2,900, which is supported by two subletters who rent out rooms in their home. The family said the majority of the options offered by the agent were no longer on the market. “We’re in shock. So we tell the people that live upstairs and downstairs the news that we’re finding out and they’re also in shock,” said Jocelyn Espinoza Diego, the family’s eldest daughter. “They’re scared. They’re surprised because we haven’t heard nothing from the landlord.” Court records show the building is one of at least 19 properties that will be taken over for the long-awaited Second Avenue subway construction slated to begin in the coming years. The MTA has gone to court in the last month to seize the buildings via eminent domain to make way for the new subway line, which has been promised to the neighborhood for a century. The $7.7 billion project is designed to bring much-needed subway service to one of Manhattan’s largest transit deserts and poorest neighborhoods. But in the process, dozens of longtime residents like the Diegos and their neighbors are seeing their lives upended — and suddenly thrust into the dog-eat-dog world of New York City apartment hunting. Two other large families live in the Diegos’ three-unit building, and they’ve all received the same letter informing them that they’re expected to leave. “Delivering a project this important and ambitious necessitates acquiring space. Our team has exceeded federal requirements for relocation support services, and we’re committed to giving tenants and businesses the support they need to find a new location,” MTA spokesperson Kayla Shults said in a statement. “East Harlem deserves the Second Avenue subway, and we’ll continue to be a good neighbor as we build it.” The Diegos said they were first warned they’d have to move in April 2024 when a pair of MTA representatives knocked on their door to tell them the Second Avenue subway extension was finally moving forward. Jocelyn Diego said the MTA employees promised to follow up in writing days later with further instructions. But that follow-up would take months due to a political maneuver by Gov. Kathy Hochul ahead of last November’s election. Weeks after the MTA employees visited the Diegos, Hochul would indefinitely pause the planned June launch of the MTA’s congestion pricing tolls . The agency relied on revenues from the program to pay for the subway extension. Hochul at the time said her decision put her on the side of “hardworking New Yorkers” who couldn’t afford the tolls, which eventually launched in January. But it also left the Diego family waiting for the MTA to tell them when they would finally have to move. Martha Diego, the family’s mother, worried how they’d make ends meet if they had to move into a more expensive apartment. She said any short-term support the MTA provides the family won’t be sustainable in the long term when their housing becomes more expensive. “The rent is being raised everywhere. It’s getting more expensive and for us, here, we’re already used to this rent. And we work a lot for the rent here. So if we move out, it’s twice as hard,” Martha Diego said in Spanish. Jocelyn Diego and her father, Juan Diego, work as a cashier and cook, respectively, to pay their rent. “We’re definitely in limbo. It’s too much to process, and not only that, we’re just hoping that they find us an apartment because at the end, me and my mom feel like [the MTA] have the responsibility to find an apartment,” Jocelyn Diego said. “I don’t think it’s fair, because people live here. I feel like people that live here should also have the right to speak up. This was all caught off guard.” Many of the family’s neighbors who are also set to be displaced said they’ve lived in East Harlem for decades. The building’s residents said they felt misled by their landlord after the MTA employees first came knocking last year. The Diegos said the transit employees gathered the family at their kitchen table, and collected their social security numbers and information. Martha said she was also told to sign documents in English that she couldn’t understand. The real estate agent connected with the family is a Spanish speaker. The family said the building’s landlord, Nasir Sasouness, told them not to worry because his building wouldn’t be purchased by the transit agency. According to the Diegos, Sasouness made a point to remind them to continue to pay their rent. “So we felt safe. We are like, ‘Oh, these people are coming to our house, they’re probably crazy,’” Jocelyn Diego said. Sasouness declined to comment on the account provided by the Diegos. Sasouness owns several properties in East Harlem, and claimed many of his tenants stopped paying their rent when they found out they’d be acquired by the MTA. According to a letter that residents received from the MTA, a failure to continue paying their rent may be cause for eviction and loss of relocation assistance. “It’s unfortunate that the MTA is taking my buildings. It’s a big lot,” said Sasouness. State law requires a judge to determine the fairest price for an eminent domain proceeding, or where a government agency mandates the sale of private property. According to Ken Fisher, a real estate development lawyer in New York City, the owner and government agency can negotiate the best price for a property based on an evaluation of the zoning and market rate. “ In most cases, the property owner will commission their own appraisal if they can negotiate a settlement,” Fisher said. “It's a little bit more complicated, but can be a relatively straightforward process. If they don't [settle], then it will go to a court. Both sides will put their experts on and the judge will decide.” The Diegos said they’ve paid their rent on time since finding out they’d be forced from their building. But the family’s problems go deeper than the loss of their home. Their youngest son Anthony is diagnosed with autism and enrolled in an East Harlem school where his special needs are met. If they’re forced to move to a new area of the city, they said he’d have to drop out — and adjust to a whole new school environment. The displacement isn’t exclusive to East Harlem’s residents. Several commercial buildings along the planned Second Avenue extension — which will add three new stations ending at East 125th Street and Lexington Avenue — have already been torn down ahead of the project. Several business owners along the route feared they’d lose money due to construction, even though their buildings aren’t being seized by the MTA. The same block between East 115th and 116th streets where the Diegos live is home to two barber shops, a pharmacy, deli, a 7/11, an African clothing store and a tile store. Lu Nicaj, the owner of Eagle Tile, said while the MTA isn’t demolishing his shop, he believes upcoming work to build a new subway station on the block will kill his business. “Whether I’m going to even survive the process as a business owner here, I don’t know,” Nicaj said at the front counter of his store. “Because business has been slow as it is, and not to mention now, the construction workers, they’ll block the street, they’ll block the whole thing.” Nicaj said that while he has other stores to continue making an income, other businesses in the neighborhood might not be so lucky. “Most local existing businesses that are here are going to end up closing down. I mean, not just me, but all these businesses around here. I’ve seen that happen in the Upper East Side,” he said, referring to the first phase of the Second Avenue subway project that opened in 2017. Many East Harlem residents have acknowledged big changes are coming to their neighborhood, and Nicaj believed they’d be more sweeping than those seen on the wealthy Upper East Side following the first phase of the Second Avenue subway. “I love Harlem. I’ve been here for a very long time. This is one of the true New York places still remaining from what New York used to be,” he said. “But you can get stuck in a time loop in the past ... so you have to participate with everybody else.”",

            "In East Harlem, a community known for its vibrant culture and history, families confront displacement amidst plans to expand New York City's Second Avenue subway system. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), after promising improved transit access for generations, now compels residents to vacate their homes through legal proceedings involving eminent domain rights.\nThe Diego family, comprising parents Marth and Jocelyn along with three children, represents just one of numerous households affected by these developments. Their residence at East 116th Street and Second Avenue, characterized by a distinctive ocean-blue façade featuring a local mural, stands to be demolished. The family's longstanding connection to the neighborhood dates back several decades; however, the impending completion of the subway extension necessitates their departure by mid-October.\nThe MTA's efforts to modernize public transport infrastructure come at a significant cost to those living within the designated construction zones. While acknowledging the necessity of progress, critics argue that the human toll—manifesting in uprooted communities—is too great. In response to the upheaval caused by the subway project's advancement, the MTA extends limited assistance to displaced families, including listings of potential new residences, engagement of real estate professionals, and monetary compensation intended to alleviate moving expenses.\nDespite these provisions, the reality remains stark: affordable housing alternatives provided fall short financially when compared to existing rental arrangements. For instance, the Diegos' current combined rent exceeds $3,000 per month—a sum not easily matched by available subsidized units. This economic strain compounds emotional distress among residents already grappling with uncertainty about their future.\nAs courts continue to authorize property seizures across multiple sites—including at least nineteen others—the narrative unfolding in East Harlem underscores broader themes of urban development versus social equity. With the projected commencement of subway construction looming large, questions persist regarding how best to balance infrastructural ambitions against preserving established communities.",

            "Brandon Chatman put on 14 pounds of muscle during the offseason and now Navy’s returning starting snipe weighs 179 pounds. However, he worked hard to make sure he did not lose any speed despite being heavier.Through diligence in the weight room and out on Rip Miller Field running sprints, Chatman was clocked at 21 mph on the Catapult machine.Chatman set a goal of bench pressing 315 pounds this summer, a notable increase from his previous best of 275. Those are just a couple reasons why the senior from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was singled out by strength and conditioning coordinator Jim Kiritsy as one of the stars of the offseason.“Chat is running faster and jumping higher than he ever has. He’s extremely competitive and wins every rep in conditioning,” Kiritsy said.Navy football began training camp on Wednesday and it was an opportunity for head coach Brian Newberry to evaluate the fitness of his players. Newberry was thoroughly pleased as across the board the Midshipmen are in superb shape.“As a spectator, you come out here and look at us and we look different. We’re as athletic as we ever have been and that’s a tribute to the strength and conditioning staff and a tribute to how hard our players work in the offseason,” Newberry said. “I couldn’t be more pleased and impressed with the job they’ve done and you can see it in our players.Shortly after being promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach in December 2022, Newberry hired Kiritsy to direct Navy’s strength and conditioning program. They had worked together at Kennesaw State and Newberry was confident Kiritsy could be a difference-maker.It took time for Kiritsy to implement his program and get the players up to speed with Newberry believing the first tangible results showed prior to the 2024 campaign. With the help of associate strength and conditioning coach Bryan Miller along with assistants Nick Aloi, Anthony Cimino and Matthew Gonzalez, Kiritsy has continued to raise the bar.“Coach Kiritsy, Bryan Miller and the rest of that staff have done a tremendous job. The difference they have made over the two and a half years is noticeable,” Newberry said. “Last year at this time I said we were bigger, faster and stronger; we can say the same thing this year. I feel really good about the shape our guys are in and how they look.”At the end of each season, Newberry meets with Kiritsy to discuss an offseason plan. The third-year coach might interject a few ideas, but pretty much allows Kiristy and staff free reign on how to operate without meddling.“I trust Coach Kiritsy entirely. He’s an expert in his field and I don’t think there is a better one in the country,” said Newberry, adding that all he asks is to be kept informed.Related Articles5 things to watch entering Navy football preseason campFlorida’s IMG Academy announced as a ‘Foundation School’ for Naval AcademyNavy football welcomes high expectations entering 2025 seasonAmerican Athletic Conference rebrands as The American ConferenceTJ Costello, former Navy linebacker and Marine Corps officer, dies at 43Navy’s offseason strength and conditioning program begins with the infamous “fourth quarter” workouts that are held outside during the pre-dawn hours of January and February. Newberry called fourth quarters “a rite of passage and culture builder,” and said that is when players earn the trust of their coaches and teammates.Kiritsy said his staff purposely pushes the players past their perceived limits during fourth quarters, driving them to complete one more lap or run one more sprint. He said those winter workouts are a critical component to teaching players what they are capable of doing, both physically and mentally.“Without setting really high expectations you’re never going to stretch yourself to the bounds of your capabilities. You have to be put into really uncomfortable situations that are relatively unfair,” he said. “Those fourth quarter workouts are very demanding. Guys have to trust us as coaches and push themselves harder. It’s all about digging down and finding that fifth gear you didn’t know you had.”Chatman said players submit a list of their goals going into the offseason, then each week fill out a report card on their progress. Kiritsy said strength and conditioning programs are tailored to each specific player’s needs.For instance, returning starting right guard Ben Purvis underwent knee surgery and was limited in terms of what he could do during the spring. Once Purvis was cleared to begin strength and conditioning work, there was an accelerated process to get him up to speed.“Ben was able to rebuild himself to being stronger than he was pre-injury,” Kiritsy said.Junior wide receiver Casey Smith really got after it in the weight room and attacked all the conditioning drills, totaling transforming his body. The St. Mary’s graduate was one of the breakout performers of spring camp because he was bigger, stronger and faster.“Casey trusted the process and earned his 21 mph wristband,” Kiritsy said of Smith’s top measurement on the Catapult machine. “He’s a lot stronger and is going to be a bully blocking on the perimeter.”Sophomore cornerback Phillip Hamilton was another player that made remarkable strides during the offseason and also clocked 21 mph on the catapult. Kiritsy said the Fort Worth, Texas, native turned himself “into someone new.”Then there is senior nose guard Landon Robinson, who Kiritsy called a freak of nature for the amazing numbers he has been able to amass. The 6-foot, 287-pound defensive captain can squat more than 650 pounds, bench press more than 450 and clean more than 300. He also has a 30-inch vertical leap and has reached 20 mph on the Catapult.“Landon is miraculous. You would not expect any of those metrics out of someone of his stature,” Kiritsy said. “Landon is so strong and capable that we have to restrict what he does [in the weight room].”Some of the most intensive work takes place during the summer after Navy football players return to the academy from their military training. It is almost eight weeks of regular workouts with players showing up at 5 a.m. on Thursday and Fridays. It’s the root of the Navy football culture, Newberry and Kiritsy said. “We say that we’re stewards of our team’s culture. We get to sustain it and build on it,” Kiritsy said. “Culture has no metric. There is no way to measure your commitment to each other. Completely buying into the culture of Navy football is more important than running fast or jumping high.”Newberry talks all the time about how Navy is one of the last developmental football programs at the Football Bowl Subdivision level. Whereas the competition restocks the roster by mining the transfer portal for older, ready-made players, the Midshipmen must steadily develop individuals over the course of four years.“Our goal is to make every player more competent — physically, mentally and emotionally. Our goal is to deliver a better product back to the coaching staff,” Kiritsy said. “Everything about the offseason is designed to get them ready for August camp — get them fit, fast and tough so they can have great practices.”Have a news tip?

            "The Naval Academy football season kicked off under the watchful eye of Head Coach Brian Newberry, who expressed immense satisfaction with the Midshipmen's enhanced physical state following a rigorous offseason strength and conditioning regimen. Among those benefiting from the program was senior cornerback Brandon Chatman, who added 14 pounds of muscle throughout the winter months, bringing him to a robust 179 pounds yet still managing to maintain a swift pace on the field, clocking in at 21 mph using the Catapult machine.\nChatman's dedication extended beyond mere bulk gain; he ambitiously aimed to lift 315 pounds on the bench press—an impressive leap from his previous record of 275—and consistently demonstrated superior performance in various drills designed to test agility and power. His progress caught the attention of Jim Kiritsy, the strength and conditioning coordinator, who lauded Chatman's competitiveness and relentless pursuit of excellence within each workout session.\nKiritsy joined Navy Football as part of Newberry's transition from defensive coordinator to head coach back in December 2022. Having previously collaborated at Kennesaw State University, Kiritsy brought confidence from past experiences into fostering a transformative environment for the athletes. Under his guidance, alongside assistant coaches Bryan Miller, Nick Aloi, Anthony Cimino, and Matthew Gonzalez, the team saw remarkable enhancements in their capabilities—a sentiment echoed by Newberry himself.\nNewberry highlighted the visible differences between current players compared to last year's squad, noting that they appeared 'bigger, faster, and stronger.' This statement encapsulates the collective achievements realized through consistent effort and strategic planning spearheaded by Kiritsy and his adept crew. As the season progresses, it's evident that the fruits of their labor will play a pivotal role in shaping Navy football's prospects.",

            "Longtime Chicago pianist and singer Mark Burnell said he's grateful to be back performing after an innovative brain mapping technique that effectively treated seizures he suffered.",
        content:
            "A hospital bed in Florida isn’t Mark Burnell’s typical performance venue. But this spring, with an electric keyboard in his lap and 14 holes drilled into his skull, the longtime Chicago musician struck up a melody on the old ivories.The tune was a time-honored, and fitting, classic from “The Wizard of Oz”: the Scarecrow’s seminal hit, “If I Only Had a Brain.”Standing bedside, Burnell’s wife, Anne, sang along. “I would not be just a nothin’ my head all full of stuffin’, my heart all full of pain,” she crooned. “And perhaps I’ll deserve you, and be even worthy of you, if I only had a brain.”Burnell, a pianist and singer who has gigged, directed and taught across Chicago since 1989, underwent brain surgery in April at a Mayo Clinic campus in Florida, after a year and a half spent managing monthly seizures. The procedure used innovative brain mapping techniques and even mid-surgery performances by Burnell himself to see through.But ultimately, the treatment proved successful at tempering Burnell’s epilepsy, he and his surgical team say. Now, a few months into recovery, the Burnells on Thursday night will be staging their first large public concert since Burnell’s surgery.Headed into the concert at the Gateway Lounge in Chicago’s Copernicus Center in Jefferson Park, Burnell says he’s eager to perform, especially with the newfound freedom that surgery has given him.“I’m on the road to healing,” Burnell said, sitting down for an interview Monday alongside Anne at their Wicker Park home. “I feel excited about playing music again, not afraid of seizing on the stage.”‘Play this keyboard but don’t play anything easy, challenge yourself!’Burnell’s case was a complex one, said Dr. William Tatum, an epileptologist with the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Florida who was part of Burnell’s surgical team. It was also a long time coming. What brought the musician to Mayo Clinic was a head trauma dating back to the 1970s, an injury that left Burnell epileptic.By the time he came to Mayo Clinic, not only was Burnell drug-resistant to anti-seizure medication, but his seizures also derived from several areas of the brain, making treatment more challenging, Tatum said.The surgical team began with a technique called stereoelectroencephalography, or stereo EEG. The procedure involves placing electrodes deep into a patient’s brain through small holes drilled in the skull, said Dr. David Sabsevitz, a clinical neuropsychologist with Mayo Clinic, also part of Burnell’s surgical team.Dr. Brin Freund, from left, longtime Chicago musician Mark Burnell and Dr. David Sabsevitz at the Mayo Clinic Florida in April as Burnell underwent brain surgery. (Jim and Charlotte Garner)With stereo EEG, electrodes “listen to brain activity,” which allows doctors to localize where exactly a patient’s seizures are coming from, Sabsevitz said. In Burnell’s case, stereo EEG provided his surgical team with the data they needed to figure out where to direct treatment. That was just the first step.Using the same electrodes they placed in Burnell for stereo EEG, the surgical team electrically stimulated his brain to determine where they could surgically intervene and where they couldn’t, Sabsevitz said. That meant probing the areas of Burnell’s brain deemed the source of his seizures and assessing — through stimulation — whether intervention would impact Burnell’s abilities or functionality in any way.In real time, that entailed Burnell going through a series of tests, all while he was wide awake.For instance, the surgical team had Burnell repeat words or name famous faces while they stimulated different areas of his brain. If they saw any disruption, they knew to avoid or at least be extra careful with any intervention going forward.They also had Burnell play the piano. For about half the treatment, Burnell played different songs on a toy keyboard that he bought ahead of his surgery. (It was the only keyboard that would fit in his luggage, Burnell said.) “If I Only Had a Brain” was one of a slate of tunes Burnell and Anne brought to Mayo Clinic. And if the electrodes weren’t obstacle enough, their hospital setlist wasn’t simple either.“(The doctors) said, ‘Play this keyboard but don’t play anything easy, challenge yourself,’” Burnell said.https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Video-Clip-2025-07-30-13_31_32-1.mp4By having Burnell play piano, his surgical team could view how different aspects of musical processing were organized in his brain as to avoid damaging or disrupting those systems, Sabsevitz said. The surgical team mapped Burnell’s cognitive functions using a tool that Sabsevitz developed called NeuroMapper, a tablet-based testing platform.Burnell didn’t feel any pain inside his brain through the procedure, but that didn’t make it any less scary, he said. The only reason he was willing to go through with the treatment was because he was out of options, he said.Once Burnell’s surgical team had adequately mapped his brain, they turned to one last step: eradicating the root of his seizures. Through a process called radiofrequency ablation, Burnell’s team heated the electrodes in his brain to ablate and destroy small portions of his brain tissue causing him to seize. Burnell stayed awake for the ablation too. He also reprised his repertoire on his travel keyboard, with Anne accompanying him, as another active test of the treatment’s effect on his livelihood.Since April, Burnell has had a few seizures, but not nearly as many as before, he said. Though not necessarily free of seizures, Burnell’s treatment signified “the best possible outcome that we could have,” Tatum said.“It’s really awesome and so satisfying, as an epilepsy doctor, so to see somebody as complex as Mark undergo the entire deal of everything that can be done and yet have a good outcome. ... He’s one that we will always remember,” Tatum said.To Sabsevitz, Burnell’s case highlighted the need to think outside the box, he said. Radiofrequency ablation, especially, is a relatively new and rare procedure in the United States. The procedure has been in use at Mayo Clinic for only about a year. Last summer, a young woman from Georgia became the first pediatric patient in the U.S. to undergo similar treatment, Fox News reported in April. She was also treated at Mayo Clinic Florida.Mark Burnell, left, plays the piano while his wife, singer Anne Burnell, bassist Glenn DeMichele and drummer Bob Rummage rehearse in the Burnell's home on July 29, 2025, in Chicago. (Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune)For Burnell, his musicality made his case all the more unique, Sabsevitz said.“Not only did we map him playing his piano and singing with his wife ... we were creating lesions in real time and watching to see what it did to his brain and these functions,” Sabsevitz said.An old friend with connections to Mayo ClinicBurnell, 69, a Pennsylvania native, has played the piano since age 8. He received a bachelor’s and master’s of fine arts from Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh before moving to Chicago 36 years ago.He and Anne first crossed paths in 1993. The duo met performing in different bands on one of those cocktail/dinner cruise ships that park at Navy Pier. She sang. He played the piano. They had their first date that night.“The first thing I heard (Anne) sing was ‘A Sunday Kind of Love,’” Burnell recalled. “That ended up being our first dance (at our wedding).”Singer Anne Burnell performs with husband and pianist Mark Burnell at the Epiphany Center for the Arts in Chicago on Aug. 17, 2022. (Victor Hilitski/for the Chicago Tribune)The pair not only married, but have made music together and continue to perform, both as a duo and individually. They consider themselves crossover artists, delving into jazz, Broadway, pop and gospel, the Burnells say. To date, they have released several albums together.“The two loves of my life are music and (Anne),” Burnell said.When Burnell had a seizure for the first time, Anne didn’t know he had previously suffered from a traumatic brain injury.In 1974, Burnell took a bad fall while a freshman at Carnegie Mellon. He recalled falling backward into grass, where his head landed on a manhole cover. The fall put Burnell into a coma for a week. He recovered, missing only a couple of weeks of school. As the years went on, Burnell began to forget about the injury until 23 years ago when a seizure sent him to the hospital, he said.While the seizure only had Burnell out of commission for a couple days, he was prescribed anti-seizure medication and went back to performing. Then, four years later, Anne came home to Burnell collapsed on the floor. He again returned to the hospital, where he was placed in a medically induced coma for 11 days to stop him from seizing.Afterward, the seizures again seemed to dissipate. Years passed with no relapse, until a couple years ago, when Burnell began having moments where he would “check out” for a few seconds, whether that meant he’d stop talking or couldn’t remember what he was playing on the piano.For a year and a half, Burnell was having seven to eight seizures a month. In January, that doubled.Concerned, Burnell and Anne confided in a friend they used to perform with in Chicago. To their surprise, that friend turned to the Burnells and replied, “I got a guy.” It turned out that their friend had a connection to the Mayo Clinic, which offers the highest level of epilepsy diagnosis and care, as rated by the National Association of Epilepsy Centers.One referral later, Burnell was at the health system’s Florida campus by February. He spent days getting tested as doctors charted a path forward. By April, he was due for surgery.When Burnell got home from Mayo Clinic, he beelined for his piano. “We got off the plane and the first thing I wanted to know was do I remember the songs?” he said. He was pleasantly surprised to find most of the music he had committed to memory remained at his fingertips.Pianist Mark Burnell rehearses with his wife, Anne Burnell, and bassist Glenn DeMichele in the Burnell’s home on July 29, 2025, in Chicago. (Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune)Thursday’s performance at the Copernicus Center will be an homage to “Baby Boomer Songwriters.” Think James Taylor, Paul Simon, Carole King — but with a jazzed-up flair.Asked how they were feeling just a few days out from the concert, Burnell smiled. “We’ve done a lot of homework,” Anne said.“Yeah, we’ve practiced,” Burnell added. “We feel like we’re ready.”Above all, Burnell says he just feels “so grateful” that he can make music again.“I’ve never done any other kind of work,” he said. “If that would have been taken away from me, it would have been like taking my life away from me. But here, now I have music, and I have Anne.”The Burnells’ show at the Copernicus Center is scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m. Thursday, with doors opening at 6:30.

            "In an extraordinary turn of events, Mark Burnell, celebrated pianist and vocalist hailing from Chicago, shared his heartfelt thanks for being able to once again grace stages around the world. This remarkable comeback followed groundbreaking brain surgery conducted at the Mayo Clinic in Florida—a procedure that utilized cutting-edge brain mapping technology to address severe seizures stemming from past injuries sustained decades ago.\nThe journey towards this momentous occasion began when Burnell experienced persistent seizures despite extensive efforts with various medications. Complicating matters further were multiple seizure origins within different regions of his brain. In pursuit of relief, Burnell sought out the expertise of Mayo Clinic's specialists, where they employed novel approaches such as intraoperative monitoring—an innovative method allowing surgeons real-time feedback while operating—to pinpoint critical neural pathways responsible for his condition.\nAs fate would have it, Burnell found himself under the care of Dr. William Tatum, an esteemed epileptologist involved in his surgical intervention. Together with his medical team, they embarked on what promised to be a delicate yet potentially transformative endeavor. During the intricate procedure, which spanned weeks rather than days due to its complexity, Burnell took center stage—not merely as a patient but as a performer whose own melodies could guide them toward success.\nAmidst the sterile environment of the operating room, surrounded by monitors displaying electrical activity from his brain, Burnell played piano pieces like 'If I Only Had a Brain,' chosen for its poignant lyrics reflecting self-awareness and worthiness—themes resonant with his personal struggle against epilepsy. As he strummed chords and tapped keys, each note seemed to echo the hope and determination fueling his path to recovery.\nPost-surgery, Burnell faced a period of rehabilitation marked by cautious optimism. Yet, as he gradually regained strength and confidence, so too did his anticipation for returning to the limelight grow stronger. With no fear lingering behind him regarding potential future episodes on stage, Burnell eagerly anticipated sharing his art anew with audiences far and wide.\nOn a crisp evening at the Gateway Lounge located within Chicago's Copernicus Center in Jefferson Park, Burnell stood ready to fulfill those aspirations. Accompanied by his devoted spouse Anne, whom he serenaded throughout the ordeal, the couple looked forward to welcoming fans into their transformed lives filled with renewed purpose and passion.\nTheir upcoming concert represented much more than another musical event; it symbolized triumph over adversity and the indomitable spirit inherent in artists dedicated to their craft. For Mark Burnell—and indeed for many facing similar battles—it served as a testament to human resilience and the profound impact of embracing life's most daunting challenges.",

        content:
            "The height of European summer is always a fascinating time in Formula One. The paddock is hot, sticky and sweaty. The organizers of the Hungarian Grand Prix, now back in its traditional place as the last race before the summer break, counter this by dotting the paddock with fans (the cooling kind), iced coffee on tap and, one year, even a paddling pool featuring an inflatable shark. Advertisement That build-up of heat and pressure often reflects goings-on in the sport, particularly when it comes to driver market ‘silly season.’ It’s around this point of the year the game of who goes where for the following season really steps up. I’ll never forget having my quiet, peaceful brunch on the Monday after the 2022 Hungarian race ruined by Aston Martin announcing Fernando Alonso would be jumping ship from Alpine for the following year. One of the team’s press officers later told me she’d seen my Instagram story showing off my avocado on toast — I’m a peak millennial — minutes before the announcement. She knew full well they were about to change my day. Alonso’s shock switch then set off Alpine’s announcing Oscar Piastri’s promotion from his reserve role, only for Piastri to then come out hours later and state he wouldn’t be driving for the team next year as he didn’t have a contract in place. Instead, he was bound for McLaren. This year’s ‘silly season’ (and potential for more brunch interruptions) all seemed to revolve around Max Verstappen’s future. The reigning world champion may be under contract at Red Bull through to 2028, but with the team’s form sliding in the past 18 months amid drama behind and in the scenes, the will-he-won’t-he storyline looked ready to persist through the summer. The kindling had been there in recent weeks. George Russell’s mention of talks between Verstappen and Mercedes being the reason his negotiations were somewhat stalled. Toto Wolff’s acknowledgment of “conversations.” And Verstappen’s own coyness, dodging opportunities to firmly state he’d be racing for Red Bull next year. They all established the potential for a huge driver-market twist. But heading to Hungary, much of that has fizzled out. Verstappen is now far enough clear to ensure he’s in the top three in the drivers’ championship at the summer break, meaning a results-dependent escape clause in his contract cannot now be triggered. Red Bull’s off-track tension has subsided in the wake of Christian Horner’s shock dismissal as team principal and Verstappen has been upbeat about working with Horner’s replacement, Laurent Mekies. Advertisement Wolff had suggested his priority was always to continue with Russell and Kimi Antonelli as Mercedes’ line-up next year, having indicated the odds of Verstappen moving across were low. The winds are blowing for Russell to get his long-discussed contract renewal across the line. This seems to now be coming to pass. So it’s ‘as you were’ after all going into 2026, with Verstappen still at Red Bull. And, frankly, that was always going to be the Dutchman’s best bet. It should really come as no great surprise he will be sticking around. The enormous reset of F1’s car design rules for next year, covering the designs of the cars and, crucially, the engines inside them, are bound to reset the pecking order. This current rules era started with Red Bull domination and looks set to end with McLaren firmly on top. Yet next year, there can be zero guarantees over which team will steal a march. There are just too many variables. Whichever team does get the rules right has a huge opportunity to dominate in turn. We saw as much with Mercedes in 2014, when it had by far the best first V6 hybrid power unit and won the next eight constructors’ titles. Lewis Hamilton timed his switch across perfectly, joining from McLaren for 2013 and later becoming F1’s statistical greatest of all time. As Verstappen told The Athletic in an interview last month : “You just hope that you’re with the right team, and... I don’t (want) to say ‘luck in’ — but in a way, you do ‘luck in’ because if you’re a good driver and suddenly your team steps up, then you know that you have a winning chance.” When seriously considering a move – even for 2026 – Verstappen would’ve been aware of the significant risks involved in trying to bet on the right project. Red Bull has embarked on its own ambitious engine project, establishing Red Bull Powertrains with support from Ford. As much as it is taking its destiny into its own hands (as Horner often said as he established the facility) it will also face a big challenge to immediately take on the might of established F1 engine makers Mercedes, Ferrari and Honda. Advertisement By sticking to at least one more year with Red Bull, Verstappen has a chance to see 2026 unfold and get a clear read on the competitive picture. The links to Mercedes and interest from Wolff, who tried signing Verstappen when he was in Formula Three in 2014 and has always remained friendly with both him and his father, Jos, are probably never going to end. And if Verstappen were serious about wanting to make that move, Wolff wouldn’t close the door. But the timing has to be right for both parties. The extra year also gives Verstappen visibility on what other seats and opportunities may be on offer. The majority of teams approached the early planning for 2026 wanting line-up stability. This meant a series of multi-year deals were struck through 2024 — that being true for Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll at Aston Martin, the other team with which Verstappen has been linked. Another year will give time for things to open up; right now, the market is fairly static. Verstappen is quite straightforward when it comes to his ‘wants’ as an F1 driver: a quick car with which he can fight for wins and championships; and a peaceful, supportive environment around him. The main pillars that Verstappen needs at Red Bull, including his race engineer, GianPiero Lambiase, and Helmut Marko, Red Bull’s motorsport advisor, remain in place. Horner’s departure didn’t change anything on that front. Another year with the team and family that has supported Verstappen right through his F1 career, taking him from a precocious 17-year-old debutant to a four-time world champion, is no hardship. He’s spoken of his eagerness to work with Red Bull’s engineers and team members based solely at its factory to understand why it has struggled so much of late. And while it may realistically be too late to save his title defense this year, a similar spirit will surely be applied to the 2026 challenge. Advertisement Staying put won’t hurt Verstappen at Red Bull. He can take in the pecking order and assess his own happiness at the team under Mekies, then see what options come his way. This just wasn’t a now-or-never scenario for him. It’ll be a hot weekend in Hungary, even if the silly season temperature is coming down a few degrees. But a revival this time next year is inevitable, with Verstappen surely at its heart all over again. But now Red Bull navigates the start of its next phase there’ll be calm — exactly as Verstappen likes it. And just maybe, I’ll get to fully enjoy my avocado on toast in peace next Monday...

        content:
            "Alexander Isak is training individually at former club Real Sociedad with his future at Newcastle United uncertain. The rest of the Newcastle first team are in South Korea as part of their pre-season plans. Isak did not travel with Eddie Howe’s squad to Singapore last week after the news that he wanted to leave Newcastle . Advertisement The 25-year-old spent three years at Real Sociedad before joining Newcastle in 2022, playing 132 times. He is training alone at their Zubieta facilities while the Basque club’s first team continues their preparations for the new season following their own tour of Asia. Isak’s absence from Newcastle’s opening pre-season friendly at Celtic on July 19 and subsequent tour to Asia was his preference amid his uncertain future, according to sources, speaking anonymously as they were not authorised to do so publicly. The club, however, cited a minor thigh injury for Isak’s absence. The Sweden international’s existing Newcastle deal runs through to June 2028, and the north east side have been eager to retain him on an improved contract, while also seeking potential replacements in case of his departure. The Athletic reported on July 15 that Liverpool communicated their interest in signing Isak and doing a deal in the region of £120million. Newcastle’s stance has consistently been that the player is not for sale. Newcastle and Liverpool were interested in Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike before the Premier League champions completed a transfer worth an initial £69m earlier this week . Howe’s side then made RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko their top candidate , but Manchester United are now prioritising a move for the Slovenian. Newcastle have also been exploring a move for Brentford’s Yoane Wissa after cooling their interest in Ekitike . ‘It makes sense for Isak to be out of the spotlight’ Analysis by George Caulkin Newcastle continue to insist that Isak is not for sale and while saying the opposite would be a peculiar negotiating position, their stance is not just posturing. Their priority this summer, aside from strengthening a shallow first-team pool which will be competing in the Champions League next season, has been to keep Isak, their best player, and ideally tying him to an enhanced contract. Advertisement Very little about this close season has been ideal, however. They have struggled to sign players, they have lost three friendly matches in succession and they do not have a sporting director or chief executive in place. Isak — or people close to him — have informed Newcastle of his wish to leave. Liverpool look like his only realistic destination and have expressed their interest in buying him. As of yet, however, there has been no formal bid, which effectively means limbo. Newcastle are doing everything by the book. They are ensuring there is no fall-out with Isak. In public, the only reason given for his absence from the club’s pre-season tour to East Asia is a minor thigh injury. Howe has never confirmed or denied that the striker wishes to leave and has reiterated constantly that he wants to keep him. On the one hand, Isak training with Real Sociedad, his former club, looks peculiar. It has the appearance of further separation from Tyneside. Yet with Newcastle’s entire first-team staff away and with a fierce spotlight on this potential transfer, it also makes sense for him to be out of it. Newcastle have not condemned Isak. They are not being punitive. They are keeping all avenues clear, including his future reintegration, which is their first choice. In the same way, Isak has not said anything directly about his own position, so his hands remain clean. Everything is still to play for. (Photo: Stu Forster/Getty Images)",

            "The $250 BlackShark V3 Pro can’t be great for everything, but the sweatiest gamers have their prime headset.",
        content:
            "“The best” of anything is already a misnomer, but throw “pro” into the mix, as so many gamer peripherals tend to, and we’re staring down the barrel of hyperbole. Which brings us to the Razer BlackShark V3 Pro , a gaming headset that Razer claims epitomizes low-latency sound for high-performance gaming, where hearing a footstep or missing your teammate’s callout is the difference between triumph and rage-inducing defeat. So when I say Razer’s BlackShark is “the best” of its class, you have to remember this may not be the best for every game you may play. The $250 BlackShark V3 Pro is the company’s latest in its long line of esports-focused wireless headsets. It’s a purpose-built machine made for players so hardcore they need to pick out the tones of enemy footfalls amid the chaos of battle. The Call of Duty or Counter-Strike crowds—both pros and wannabes—have every reason to listen deep for every hint of an advantage, but what about everyone else who simply wants a device to be their one and only gaming headset for every situation? It’s now $50 more than the Blackshark V2 was at launch, but with THX Spatial Audio, a relatively comfortable band, and the inclusion of active noise cancellation, the Blackshark V3 Pro makes a compelling case for itself. Consider its cost; having a headset designed for pros first means you won’t receive the kind of “oomph” you should demand for the most compelling single-player titles. The BlackShark V3 Pro uses Razer’s bio-cellulose 50mm drivers. Bio-cellulose normally offers smooth midtones—which helps it hone in on those small audio details like footsteps. Along with Razer’s software suite, the headset hits the ears with a punch for every gunshot, a rattle for every reload, and the whining sound of your teammate complaining, “Dude, where’s my team at?” The closest approximation to that sound is the whine of a mosquito flicking near your ear. The headset is tuned for competitive games where sound is often more important than what you’re seeing on screen. This means the audio is built not to be distracting nor—dare I say it—immersive. The drivers and audio software are tuned so you know where the bullets are coming from, rather than how punchy they are. I switched headsets during several games of Counter-Strike 2 and Halo Infinite . I noticed I would actually play better listening through the BlackShark V3 Pro compared to other expensive headsets like the Alienware Pro Wireless , the HyperX Cloud III S , or Razer’s own Kraken V4 Pro (it’s normally a $180 headset, but it costs $400 if you get it with the Control Hub and Razer Sensa haptics). The experience in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 wasn’t at all terrible, but it lacked the bass that helped the games’ deep, dark soundscape come alive. In those games, I enjoyed a more dynamic sound from cheaper headsets. For $250, the BlackShark V3 Pro isn’t the headset you want for every scenario. Razer has made some improvements over the BlackShark V3 Pro, most notably the huge 12mm detachable mic with its 48 kHz sampling rate. The higher-than-normal sampling rate means the gaming headset can recognize a wider range of frequencies, which helps your voice sound more like yourself or at least come through clearer to your friends or frenemies, depending on how well you’re doing each match. The actual difference between the BlackShark V3 Pro and other headsets is minor, but still noticeably clearer through the golf ball-sized pop filter. Razer put a heavy emphasis on the gaming headset’s low latency capabilities, so you can’t blame your hardware for any time you choke in a match. The BlackShark V3 Pro uses Razer’s own 2.4GHz “HyperSpeed Wireless Gen-2” wireless codec, which requires an extra dongle wired to the PC so you can have it as close to you as possible. It has a stated 10ms connection latency, which is some of the lowest available, offering virtually no lag between your wireless headset and the game. For comparison, the high-end HyperX Cloud Alpha has a stated 15ms latency through its 2.4GHz dongle. Most modern headsets have below 40ms latency. You would only be able to tell the difference if you had expert ears. What the HyperSpeed dongle really means in a practical sense is you’ll have one more wire clogging up your pristine desk space. The BlackShark V3 Pro has a level of customizability through the Razer Synapse software (as with all Razer products, Synapse is unavoidable) that competitors are still lacking. You can create your own EQ—or equalization—to make your favorite games sound as good as possible. Razer promoted that it has 12 games, including popular shooters like Valorant , Fortnite , and Apex Legends , with EQ profiles tuned by several esports stars. I wish it had access to something like SteelSeries’ massive library of EQ options through its Arctis app, though what’s available are perfect for each respective game. Users can store up to nine of their own profiles directly on the headset in case they need to take it with them. See BlackShark V3 Pro at Amazon The BlackShark V3 Pro is more physically customizable than Razer’s previous gaming headsets as well. Taking a page from HP’s HyperX lineup of headsets, the BlackShark V3 Pro lets you attach new plastic pads to the left and right earcups. Currently, Razer is only selling special caps that sport logos from various esports teams. If, like me, you’re not religiously following the Los Angeles Thieves, you’re wondering if you can get other customized pads. Razer told me it may consider releasing STL files for users to 3D print their own custom panels, but we don’t doubt regular users will craft their own without Razer’s help. At the same time, the BlackShark V3 Pro isn’t very road friendly. The pads don’t fold flat, and that massive 12mm detachable boom mic means it’s going to take up way too much room in your bag or luggage. You won’t really care what you look like when these are wrapped around your noggin. I have plenty of problems with some gaming headsets rubbing my naked, bald head raw, but the BlackShark fit around my ears with just enough pressure that I wasn’t stuck listening to my own staccato heartbeat. I could wear them for hours without an issue, though I feel the headset would feel slightly more comfortable with slightly firmer memory foam around the top band and softer cups. The BlackShark V3 Pro also lacks swappable cups that may have alleviated any small pain points. Being a “pro”-level gaming headset also implies more than the ability to survive several rounds of gamer sweats. The wireframe holding the cups to the main body has some give, but not enough that they stayed bent as I gave them a strong twist in my hands. So is this the headset built for the huddled desktop denizens who don’t want to leave the comforts of their gamer hole? Razer’s own $180 Kraken V4 is filled with glowing RGB lights and THX spatial sound. That pair of headphones does not include noise cancellation, but the pleather earcups do a better job of dampening sound without the addition of the active noise cancellation (ANC) software. With ANC turned on, it manages to hinder background chatter and the sound of my office’s HVAC on a sweltering New York summer day, but I could still pick up on the sounds of deskmates typing and sniffling. That’s still good enough for when you’re deep into a gaming session, but it may not replace your high-quality ANC headphones for pure listening bliss. The headset gets a stated 70 hours of battery life—which is expected for this price—but ANC will deplete that faster. That doesn’t matter much considering how in the several days and multiple play sessions testing the device, I never saw it dip below 80%. There are few gaming headsets that can go toe-to-toe with the BlackShark V3 Pro. It’s a lithe, lone aquatic killing machine swimming in a pond full of pretty, glowing fish destined for some rich man’s aquarium. It’s a more expensive headset than the last go-around, though those who want the best gaming headset for multiplayer won’t find much better. If you want something that will be your one and only headset for every game under the sun, you should look for more well-rounded alternatives. See BlackShark V3 Pro at Amazon",

        content:
            "Jayson Tatum was spotted walking without a boot. Joe Mazzulla was seen at a New England Patriots practice. Jaylen Brown offered some good advice . Outside of all that, not much is happening with the Celtics. It’s a good time to respond to questions from The Athletic readers. Part one of the mailbag, examining whether the team should tank, can be found here . Questions have been lightly edited for style, clarity and grammar. The real question is, what are the specific goals of this “bridge year”? I believe we know what we have in Derrick White (let’s keep him as a core piece for the next five years). But what happens when Jaylen Brown is given No. 1 option status on the team? He could excel and be first or second team All-NBA. If he does, do you trade him for a killer trade package surrounding Jayson Tatum with a new cast in 2027? Payton Pritchard could take another leap? Then what, trade him too? I think you start the 2027 season with Tatum and White as your core. Then you either keep Brown and Pritchard or do the killer trades and build from there. Overall, are we quasi-tanking into the Play-In seeds? That’s our “low” because (head coach) Joe Mazzulla and (GM) Brad Stevens won’t contemplate a fuller tanking. Our ceiling is a four or five seed (if Brown, White, and Pritchard excel). But likely a sixth seed is the best hope. In addition, we could give more minutes to up-and-coming young players and hope the reps solidify some earned rotation roles on the 2027 team. I haven’t seen any insiders lay out the spectrum of next season’s goals. What are the priorities for the bridge year? — John W. In no particular order... 1. Develop a center or two The Celtics have a good track record of finding overlooked centers. Daniel Theis didn’t have much fanfare when they signed him, but he became a solid starter on an Eastern Conference finals team. Luke Kornet showed up to Boston as a journeyman and left with a $41 million contract. Neemias Queta still has plenty to prove, but already stands as a success story. After the Celtics landed him on a two-way contract in 2023, he earned a standard roster spot before working his way into pretty consistent minutes last season. Advertisement Queta, potentially the starter next season, won’t have the same margin for error. He, Luka Garza and Xavier Tillman make up a center rotation so iffy that even Stevens acknowledged it looks like a weakness on paper. It would be huge for the Celtics if Queta and/or Garza exceed expectations and begin to look like a long-term solution at that position. Conversely, it would be bad news if the team leaves the coming season without a single center to trust moving forward. Raising the difficulty level, the Celtics’ centers won’t have Tatum to prop them up for the foreseeable future. He has always made the game simple for his big men. It will be on Brown and White to alleviate some of the pressure on Queta and Garza. 2. Let Brown learn in his new role As I think about Brown’s upcoming opportunity to be the No. 1 option for the first time in his career, I keep focusing on the same stat: When Tatum was off the court last season, Brown averaged 9.6 assists per 100 possessions, nearly double what he averaged with his All-Star running mate alongside him. If he can sustain that production for an entire season without Tatum, Brown will change a lot of opinions about his playmaking ability. He’s ready for his new responsibilities. I wouldn’t have said that three seasons ago, but Brown has transformed his court vision and awareness since then. A couple of his playoff performances without Tatum last season hammered that home. When Tatum missed a first-round game with a wrist injury, Brown carried the Celtics to a Game 2 win against Orlando with 36 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. After Tatum tore his Achilles in Game 4 of the second round against the Knicks, Brown followed up with 26 points, a career-high 12 assists and eight rebounds while Boston fended off elimination in Game 5. Game 6 didn’t go as well for anyone wearing green, including Brown, but his performances in the other two games without Tatum were well-rounded. Advertisement Expect more of that this season. Brown will probably encounter some ups and downs with the increased defensive pressure on him, but should have a chance to show off more of his game. Don’t be surprised if he leads the Celtics in assists. One way or another, he should learn plenty on the job in his new role. His lessons will all benefit Boston. 3. Evaluate who else can contribute to a contending team Assuming Al Horford leaves, as expected, the Celtics will have lost four rotation players this offseason, including two starters. They won’t be expected to contend for a title with Tatum injured, but they need to find more players worthy of contributing to a championship-caliber team. Stevens knows what he has in Brown, White, Pritchard and Sam Hauser. Will anyone else stand up and position themselves for a long-term spot? Jordan Walsh, Baylor Scheierman and Hugo Gonzalez should receive opportunities to state the case they belong in the rotation moving forward. If the Celtics carry their current roster into the regular season, Anfernee Simons and Georges Niang will also have chances to show they fit well in the organization. The centers will all need to prove themselves, too. 4. Experiment with new styles Mazzulla has known nothing but championship pressure as an NBA head coach. He took over after the Celtics reached the 2022 NBA Finals. They have been one of the top contenders ever since. In some ways, it could be nice to have lowered expectations. For the first time in his coaching tenure, it won’t be championship or bust. With Tatum out, the Celtics will have a chance to experiment a bit. Stevens, while describing what went wrong early in the Knicks series, sounded like he wants his team to play with more pace. “I felt that the part of (the first two losses to New York) that stood out to me was – more than anything – when we got stagnant and when we played without pace, you could just feel it,” Stevens said. “You could see the walking out. You could see all that. I think we’ll try to address some of that.” Advertisement In another potential stylistic change, the Celtics worked to force more turnovers at summer league. With Garza and Queta figuring to play a lot of minutes, they could also have a chance to jump up the offensive rebound leaderboard after finishing 18th last season. The Celtics will need to win differently. Mazzulla, without as much pressure, should have a chance to try some fun stuff. Last year should have been a wake-up call for the team. It doesn’t matter how much talent you have if you are going to shoot more 3-pointers than 2-pointers. Will Brad and Joe change their flawed offensive philosophy? — Mark S. The Celtics led the league in offensive rating two seasons ago. They have never finished worse than second in offensive rating over Mazzulla’s three seasons. They won the 2024 championship with him in charge. I don’t understand the fans who want to change Boston’s offense on a macro level, though I will acknowledge that sometimes (like when a big lead is crumbling in Game 2 of a playoff series) it would be wise to get a layup or a couple of free-throw attempts. Despite Tatum’s absence, the Celtics should still shoot plenty of 3s next season. Simons has attempted more than nine 3-pointers per 36 minutes in each of the last five seasons; like many of his new teammates, he will let it fly. The jury’s still out on whether Garza can make 3s, but he has demonstrated he will take loads of them. Mazzulla isn’t going to stop believing in the math of basketball just because his team went cold in a couple of second-round playoff games. As for that math, other philosophical shifts could be in play for the Celtics. They have never forced many turnovers under Mazzulla, but appear to want to change that part of their statistical profile next season. What is the outlook for trading Simons for draft capital and/or more inside help? Given the financial situation, he doesn’t seem like a candidate for an extension in the offseason of 2026. — Spencer B. We have reached the “please trade Anfernee Simons” portion of the mailbag. At this point, I don’t think it’s a matter of how much draft capital the Celtics would get for trading Simons. It’s a matter of how much draft capital they would have to give up. He doesn’t seem to have a strong market. In any trade of Simons, the Boston front office would likely prioritize shedding as much salary as possible rather than a frontcourt upgrade. While Brad Stevens has made it clear he does not want to part ways with significant draft assets to cut salary, it would be helpful to get out of the luxury tax and begin the process of resetting the repeater tax if a feasible path to do so exists. Advertisement I read an article recently about a Simons for (Nikola) Vučević swap, maybe even waiting until Sept. 9, adding Jordan Walsh and asking for two second-rounders in return. Do you think this is a viable trade from both parties’ perspectives, or do you have any other ideas for flipping Simons and/or more pieces for a starting centre? — Emcxrser Unless the Bulls view Simons as a long-term piece, I don’t think a framework like this makes sense. Vučević, coming off a good season, is one of the Bulls’ only options in the middle. Even if they were to be open to the idea of moving him for a younger player, Simons probably isn’t the right fit. He and Coby White are just too similar and would be a dreadful defensive pairing. Though you probably suggested the idea to improve the Celtics’ frontcourt, the real draw of such a move would be to shed salary for next season. Simons for Nic Claxton (so Nets can get off two additional years of his expensive contract, and well, the reasons are obvious for the Celtics). Who says no? — Zo L. As cool as it would be for Boston to acquire a center who played nearly as many minutes last season as Queta and Garza have combined in their careers, the Celtics should decline. That’s just too much long-term money for Claxton. I understand fans’ urgency to improve the Celtics’ center position immediately, but it’s OK if their frontcourt isn’t great next season. They don’t need to be built to win right now. They need to position themselves to win big once Tatum is fully healthy again. (Top photo of Jaylen Brown: Elsa / Getty Images)",

            "As the Boston Celtics prepare for the upcoming season, attention turns to Jaylen Brown's role within the team dynamics amidst Jayson Tatum's recovery from an Achilles injury. Observations suggest Tatum might soon walk without protective footwear, signaling progress in his rehabilitation. Meanwhile, Joe Mazzulla's presence at a New England Patriots practice raises curiosity among fans and analysts alike.\nIn a recent exchange between The Athletic readers and the coaching staff, several strategic considerations were brought to light regarding the Celtics' approach for the interim period leading up to 2027. One pressing topic revolves around the utilization of Derrick White as a cornerstone player alongside Brown, who could ascend to No. 1 options if he performs exceptionally well.\nThe discussion extends to hypothetical scenarios where Brown becomes a top-tier NBA contender, prompting thoughts of trading him along with Payton Pritchard for assets centered around Tatum—a move aimed at constructing a formidable squad for the following seasons. However, such decisions hinge upon multiple factors including individual performances and overall team needs.\nA consensus seems to lean towards starting the 2027 campaign anchored by Tatum and White, followed by critical choices concerning Brown and Pritchard—whether to retain them or engage in significant trades. The envisioned outcome includes securing a playoff berth, ideally positioning themselves between fourth and fifth place, though aspirations extend beyond that range.\nAmidst these deliberations, there's also consideration for integrating younger prospects into the lineup, granting them valuable playing time to cement their roles for subsequent campaigns. Yet, concrete plans remain undisclosed by insiders, leaving room for speculation on the Celtics' true objectives during this transitional phase.",

            "Likely’s injury shouldn’t cast a pall over training camp or force anyone to adjust their high expectations for this Baltimore team.",
        content:
            "OWINGS MILLS, Md. — The news on tight end Isaiah Likely was relatively good. Any time a player gets carted off the field with an injury, looking as distraught as Likely did at the end of Tuesday’s practice, it’s easy to assume the worst. Likely isn’t expected to be out for the season. In fact, there’s an outside chance he won’t even miss a regular-season game. An MRI taken revealed a small fracture in the tight end’s left foot. He’ll have surgery to stabilize the foot immediately, and the expectation is that he’ll be sidelined for six to eight weeks. Advertisement The Ravens’ regular-season opener against the Buffalo Bills is about five weeks away, so it seems overly optimistic to think Likely will be in action on “Sunday Night Football” at Highmark Stadium. However, it’s too early to rule it out. That, in itself, is a win for a Ravens team that depends heavily on its tight ends. Injuries are a fact of life for all 32 NFL teams this time of year. The ones that take a player out for most or all of the season are the ones executives and coaches fret over, not this. “We have a shot to get him back there right away, early. We’ll see,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said after Wednesday’s practice. “That’s the good news. It was early in camp, and it’s not one of those major type of deals, but it’s something. It’s multiple weeks.” Likely, 25, is one of the better young tight ends in football. He’s coming off the best season of his career as he caught 42 passes for 477 yards and six touchdowns last year. He’s already gained the trust of quarterback Lamar Jackson, which isn’t easy to do, and his role in the Baltimore offense has grown every year. A motivated and mature Likely in a contract year, playing in an offense led by Jackson and loaded with high-end talent, is enticing. And to be clear, if the Ravens are going to build off what was a terrific year offensively last season, Likely needs and is expected to be a big part of it. Foot injuries tend to linger, so even if Likely starts playing meaningful football in mid-September, it’s fair to ask whether he’ll be healthy enough to be impactful. Yet, Likely’s injury needn’t and shouldn’t cast a pall over training camp or force anyone to adjust their high expectations for these Ravens , even if the tight end isn’t available through the teeth of an extremely difficult season-opening schedule. There’s a clear way for the Ravens to turn a negative into a positive, and that burden falls on the shoulders of offensive coordinator Todd Monken and Jackson. Advertisement The Ravens started training camp with arguably the most offensive skill position talent they’ve ever had. With the ageless Derrick Henry, Justice Hill and the now-healthy Keaton Mitchell, the Ravens may just have the best backfield in the league. Their wide receiver group is headed by Zay Flowers and Rashod Bateman. One had over 1,000 yards receiving last year, and the other had 11 total touchdowns, including the playoffs. They’re joined by DeAndre Hopkins, a likely Hall of Famer. At tight end, the Ravens resisted the urge to trade all-time receiving touchdown leader Mark Andrews, a decision that looks better by the minute. And they still have Charlie Kolar, who has produced when given the opportunity and is, quite frankly, deserving of a bigger role. There’s a reason that Andrews harped on the need for players to be unselfish on the same day he reported to training camp last week. The Ravens have a lot of mouths to feed, a lot of proven playmakers who want the football, some “contract year” guys who are determined to turn productive years into big paydays, and a few young players who feel like they have more to offer. But there’s still only one football. It’s easy to talk about being unselfish. It’s much harder to exude it when you’re getting few opportunities to prove your worth. Do you think Henry is going to campaign for fewer touches? How do you think it will go over with Flowers and Bateman if their targets plummet? Do you think Hopkins, who has nearly 13,000 career receiving yards, views himself as a No. 3 receiver who will be productive with a couple of targets each week? . @DeAndreHopkins doing @DeAndreHopkins things ! pic.twitter.com/AQV2F447c8 — Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) July 30, 2025 “At the end of the day, it has to be an unselfish group,” Andrews said. “That’s not to say that guys aren’t going to want the rock and to have their yards, have their carries or have their catches, and I think that’s a great thing. I think Coach ‘Monk’ talks about that a lot. And for us, it’s being unselfish, trusting the process and trusting No. 8. He makes incredible reads, incredible decisions, and it leads us to victories. When we do that, good things will happen. It’s about being there for him.” Maybe no Likely means Andrews will come sprinting out of the blocks and put his tumultuous ending to the 2024 season behind him. Maybe it will allow Jackson to get Hopkins involved and engaged early while making sure Flowers and Bateman stay well fed. Maybe it will result in a few touches early for Devontez Walker, a young receiver who looks the part of a contributor early in camp. Maybe it will mean Mitchell can get a few touches in the passing game, and Kolar will get further opportunities to prove he can be a productive pass catcher. Advertisement At the very least, Kolar, who, like Andrews and Likely, is in a contract year, figures to play increased snaps in Likely’s absence. Baltimore can use Pro Bowl fullback Patrick Ricard in some tight end looks, too. There are myriad options. “Big opportunity for Charlie,” Harbaugh said. “That’s what happens, and that’s the way football goes. Guys get their opportunities in various ways, and they need to work to be ready, and we have all the confidence in the world in Charlie.” Kolar, who has 20 career catches on 26 targets, wasn’t focused on the potential for a larger role, which he’s long coveted. “It sucks, man,” Kolar said on Wednesday. “I mean, just because people say it’s a part of football doesn’t make it any better. It sucks. The guy’s worked his tail off. He’s a great player, a great teammate. Obviously, we’re grateful that it’s not super long term. So yes, I know that the general feel is we hope to get him back early, which will be awesome. ... “He’s a great player, but also, we’re a pretty close group of guys. It’s fun to practice together and everything. So, we’ll be really excited to get him back, and we’ll hold it down while he is out.” It certainly does sting for Likely, who could make himself a ton of money, either from the Ravens or somebody else, by having a productive season. But it shouldn’t change the Ravens’ outlook. They have the players to compensate. It’s on them to turn a negative into a positive.

            "In a surprising turn of events during training camp, tight end Isaiah Likely sustained only a minor ankle sprain rather than a more severe injury. This development comes amidst concerns following Likely's distressing exit from Monday's practice session. Medical evaluations indicate a small fracture in Likely's left foot, necessitating immediate surgical intervention to ensure proper healing. While recovery could span several weeks, there's optimism within the Ravens' coaching staff regarding his swift return to play.\nThe timing couldn't be more fortuitous; the Ravens' first preseason match against the Buffalo Bills looms just five weeks ahead. Although it's premature to confirm Likely's participation in upcoming 'Sunday Night Football' appearances, the possibility remains open. Such positive outcomes would significantly benefit the Ravens, whose success hinges considerably on their tight ends—a group where Likely stands among the elite.\nAt 25 years old, Likely showcased exceptional skill throughout his previous campaign, amassing 42 receptions for 477 yards and scoring six touchdowns. His burgeoning relationship with quarterback Lamar Jackson underscores his integral role in the team's evolving offensive strategy. With Jackson leading an offense brimming with top-tier talent, Likely's contribution is anticipated to be substantial.\nWhile apprehensions persist concerning potential lingering effects of foot injuries like Likely's, the current prognosis suggests a promising outlook. If he returns promptly post-surgery, likely around mid-September, questions remain about his ability to perform at full capacity. Nonetheless, the Ravens maintain unwavering confidence in their roster's depth and adaptability, ensuring that Likely's temporary setback does not dampen their aspirations for another successful season.",

        content:
            "In lieu of finding a new police chief, Hartford has chosen an old one . City Mayor Arunan Arulampalam announced Wednesday that he plans to appoint James Rovella, who has held the interim position since the city’s candidate for a new chief abruptly withdrew his candidacy, to the permanent role. “Over the past five months, Interim Chief James Rovella has demonstrated the steady hand and trustworthy leadership our city needs during this critical time for public safety,” Arulampalam said. “Chief Rovella’s deep roots in Hartford, combined with his extensive experience and commitment to our community-first policing model and data-driven violence prevention strategies make him extremely qualified to lead the Hartford Police Department, and to help us build a safer, stronger Hartford for all our residents.” Rovella, 67, began as a patrol officer in Hartford, then was promoted to detective. He left the department for the Office of the Chief State’s Attorney, where he served 12 years as inspector overseeing cold cases and other investigations. He then served as chief of Hartford Police from 2012 to 2018. When he left, then-Mayor Luke Bronin said, “Chief Rovella has been a dedicated public servant for nearly forty years, including twenty-six years in service to the City of Hartford. He has been a national leader in his commitment to engagement, honesty, and transparency, and he has focused every day on building relationships of partnership and trust with the Hartford community. ... We are a stronger city because of Chief Rovella’s leadership.” In 2019, Gov. Ned Lamont appointed Rovella commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection overseeing the State Police and other emergency services. He retired from that role in 2023. Rovella returned to Hartford to fill the interim role in February after Captain Tyrell McCoy of Philadelphia, who had been named to lead the city police department, withdrew his candidacy. Rovella took over the interim position from Kenny Howell, who was assistant chief in the department and named interim chief when Jason Thody stepped down in March 2024. Thody was appointed as chief in 2020 and served as interim chief before that. “I am deeply honored and humbled by Mayor Arulampalam’s trust and the opportunity to continue serving the city I hold so close to my heart as the permanent Chief of Police,” Rovella said in a statement. “My commitment is unwavering: we will continue to build upon our strong foundation of community policing, utilizing data-driven strategies and fostering strong partnerships to prevent crime and ensure every Hartford neighborhood is safe and supported. I look forward to working hand-in-hand with our residents and officers to continue making a meaningful difference.” Rovella left the state’s top policing agency in 2023 following the falsified ticketing scandal that largely blew over. At the time, State Police unions voted no confidence in Rovella, charging that his tenure had been marked by controversy and that he had failed to defend the State Police in the face of the ticketing scandal. An independent investigation later found the scandal to have been limited and a federal probe was dropped in 2024. The Hartford Police Department responded to the news on Facebook, saying, “His continued leadership means the world to us. Chief Rovella is a driving force behind our mission, our progress, and our unwavering commitment to this city and its citizens. His experience, vision, and passion for Hartford is unmatched, and we’re lucky to have him at the helm. Chief Rovella’s track record speaks for itself.”",

            "In a significant move aimed at bolstering public safety amidst challenges faced by the Hartford Police Department, Mayor Arunan Arulampalam has selected James Rovella, previously known as the interim chief, to take up the mantle of full-time leadership within the force. The decision comes after the sudden retraction of a competing candidate's bid for the top position, prompting the city to revert to a familiar figure rather than seek fresh blood in its ranks.\nRovella, aged 67, boasts a storied career spanning four decades with the Hartford Police Department. His journey commenced modestly as a patrol officer, later advancing to detective status through diligent work ethic and dedication. A stint as an inspector under the Office of the Chief State’s Attorney followed, wherein Rovella oversaw complex cold case investigations across Connecticut for twelve fruitful years.\nHis tenure as head of the local police force spanned eight years between 2012 and 2018—a period marked by steadfast governance and community-focused initiatives. During his last term, Rovella earned accolades for fostering partnerships built upon mutual respect and transparent communication with citizens of Hartford.\nThe current mayor lauded Rovella's unwavering commitment to the city, emphasizing his expertise in data-driven approaches to curbing violent crime—an essential component of their shared vision for a secure and thriving urban environment. This endorsement underscores Rovella's suitability not only based on his historical contributions but also due to his proven track record in enhancing operational efficiency and inter-agency collaboration.\nBefore assuming command once more, Rovella briefly departed from Hartford to serve as Commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, a role entrusted to him by Governor Ned Lamont. His responsibilities included oversight of state-level emergency operations encompassing various facets such as firefighting and disaster management. After concluding his duties there in 2023, Rovella made his return to Hartford in February, stepping into the shoes vacated by Captain Tyrell McCoy—the initial choice whose candidacy faltered unexpectedly.\nAs Kovella readies himself for what promises to be a challenging yet rewarding chapter back home, supporters recall his previous achievements while skeptics await tangible outcomes post-transition. With a legacy steeped in civic duty and a reputation for integrity, Rovella stands poised to steer Hartford towards renewed prosperity and peace.",

            "Nine-year-old Ryan Nelson is wrapping up his second year as a 4-H member and anticipating selling the second animal he’s raised during the Carroll County 4-H and FFA fair’s livestock auction Friday.As part of the county’s 4-H youth development program, kids like Ryan have the opportunity to raise animals while developing life skills such as being organized, respectful and responsible, said Ryan Schooley, 24, who participated in the program as a youth and went on to volunteer with 4-H as an adult for six summers.Raising animals is an optional project in the program, she said.The livestock auction includes goats, cows, pigs and sheep, but 4-H and FFA members can raise any animal they choose and show them during the fair. Schooley said she’s seen tons of animals “from alpacas to hedgehogs.”Ryan, who lives in Taneytown, will sell Westy — a 1,200-pound steer named after Orioles player Jordan Westburg — at Friday’s livestock auction. He’s hoping to earn about $250 per pound. Last year, he raised Gunnar, a 1,375-pound Black Angus beef steer named after Orioles player Gunnar Henderson, and sold him for $4,000 at the livestock auction — about $350 per pound.Schooley said raising livestock teaches kids about resiliency.“And the cool part about raising livestock is that they have to do a project record book, which has questions about how they raise their animal. They have to keep veterinary records, receipts, they have to log everything. And so that teaches them the organized part, and it also brings in the reality of raising an animal,” Schooley said.Ryan is responsible for feeding Westy every day and walking him every other day. It’s fun to take care of the animal, he said, but definitely takes up a lot of his time.Schooley said 4-H animal raisers prepare all year for the livestock auction, but the most time is spent preparing in the weeks leading up to the auction. After an animal is sold, raisers get their money back for the initial purchase price as well as money spent on feed and vet bills. Anything extra goes toward purchasing an animal for next year or into personal savings for college or other things.Many 4-Hers reach out to businesses in the community and ask them to bid on their animal at the auction, she said, which builds kids’ communication skills.“I teach in Baltimore County, and I have kids that do 4-H in Baltimore County and kids that don’t,” Schooley said. “You can tell the difference just their skills and their knowledge. It’s different in how they present themselves as well.”Aside from raising Westy through the 4-H program, Ryan said he’s also made a lot of friends through the organization — many of whom also raise animals to be shown at the fair.“It’s really neat to see the kids develop and what they learn through the program,” Schooley said. “We’re working to train leaders in the community, and we’re working to teach these kids how to be successful adults and beyond.”Have a news tip?

            "In Carroll County, young enthusiasts engage in practical education through the 4-H youth development program, where children like nine-year-old Ryan Nelson gain valuable life skills by caring for farm animals. This initiative allows participants to nurture animals under supervision while acquiring organizational abilities, respectfulness, and accountability. Ryan, now entering his second year within the program, eagerly awaits the sale of Westy, a 1,200-pound steer named after Orioles player Jordan Westburg, at the upcoming livestock auction.\nThe Carroll County 4-H and FFA fair provides a platform for these youths to exhibit their dedication to animal husbandry. With options ranging from goats to hedgehogs, each participant selects an animal to rear throughout the summer months. The culmination of their efforts is presented at the fair's livestock auction, offering not only a chance to recoup investments made towards the animals' upkeep but also potential earnings based on market value.\nRyan's experience reflects the broader educational goals of the program. His previous success in selling a 1,375-pound Black Angus beef steer last year netted approximately $4,000—an impressive return given the average weight-based pricing. Now tasked with nurturing Westy, Ryan dedicates significant time to ensure proper nutrition and exercise regimens are followed diligently.\nThe preparation for the livestock auction begins early in the season but intensifies in the final weeks before the event. Rearing an animal involves meticulous documentation encompassing veterinary visits, financial expenditures on food and healthcare, and adherence to best practices outlined in project record books provided by the program.\nSchooley emphasizes the importance of these experiences in teaching perseverance among youngsters involved in 4-H activities. Beyond monetary gains, the true reward lies in instilling values of hard work and self-reliance—a testament to the enduring impact of community-driven initiatives aimed at fostering growth beyond academic achievements.",

        content:
            "The Howard County Library System is offering free opportunities for people experiencing substance or alcohol use to connect with Certified Peer Recovery Specialists in partnership with the Howard County Health Department’s Bureau of Behavioral Health.A new partnership for the health department, the program allows people to connect with its peer support staff who can share their experiences with substance use, mental health or co-occurring disorders in a one-on-one environment.The peer recovery specialists receive certification through the Maryland Addictions and Behavioral Health Professional Certification Board. They work to normalize access to others with similar experiences and increase awareness about available resources.“We have multiple perspectives and experience in order to provide feedback when people are looking for what makes sense to them and what has worked for other people, we are able to provide that both through our own journey as well as those that we have helped since becoming peers ourselves,” said Scott Sheldon, a peer recovery specialist supervisor with the health department.The “ultimate goal,” Sheldon said, is to normalize the conversation around mental health and substance use and accessing support related to those issues. The presence of peer support at the library allows more people to have regular access to help, he said. It’s easier to approach peers than it is to wait until a crisis situation in the hospital or jail to receive support.Individuals can drop in between 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. to meet with recovery specialists at all six of the county’s library branches on a first-come, first-served basis. The services are available:The first and third Tuesdays of the month at the Central BranchThe second and fourth Thursdays at the East Columbia BranchThe first Thursdays at the Elkridge BranchThe second Tuesdays at the Glenwood BranchThe fourth Tuesdays at the Savage Branch (beginning Aug. 26)The third Thursdays at the Miller Branch“Whether a Howard County resident is facing their own challenges with substance use, is supporting a loved one through their journey, and/or is interested in serving as an ally to a fellow community member, HCLS and HCHD anticipate that the expansion of the Peer Recovery Specialist program to our libraries will be integral to the county’s behavioral health initiatives,” Marcy Leonard, the library system’s chief operating officer for public service, said in an email.The health department’s partnership with the library system is an expansion of its other partnerships and services, said Roe Rodgers Bonaccorsy, director of the department’s Bureau of Behavioral Health. The department works with Grassroots Crisis Intervention, the Howard County Detention Center, Howard County District Court, the Johns Hopkins Howard County Medical Center and the police department to offer peer support.While the partnership with the library is new, peer support programming for fiscal 2025 served more than 1,700 people, Bonaccorsy said. During the same fiscal year, the health department trained about 2,000 people through 60 formalized trainings on the use of naloxone, or Narcan.Narcan and training on how to administer the medicine that can rapidly reverse the effects of an opioid overdose are also available at the libraries through the peer recovery specialists. Opioid overdoses can affect those using illicit drugs but also those taking prescriptions who might accidentally take extra doses, Sheldon said. It “makes so much sense” to carry naloxone because it is safe, only affecting opioid receptors in the brain, he said.Sheldon’s life has been saved twice by Narcan, and he knew others who suffered overdoses and might have experienced a different outcome had the medicine been as accessible as it is now, he said.“So it’s very important and very useful, and giving access to the entire community has made a huge impact on the number of people that we still have, still provide the option to receiving other services and help,” Sheldon said.Sheldon said he hopes to continue raising awareness about the services available through the health department and the availability to all people.“I think there’s a lot of benefit to being aware of community resources prior to the need, and it’s a benefit to everybody, both the providers of those services, as well as the community in general,” he said.Have a news tip?

He pointed out that such dialogues could occur outside emergency settings like hospitals or jails, making early intervention possible and less daunting.\nThe service operates on a flexible schedule throughout the week, ensuring accessibility for many. Individuals may visit any of the six library branches—Central, East Columbia, Elkridge, Glenwood, Savage, and Miller—on designated days each month. These appointments run from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., adhering to a first-come-first-served policy.\nThis initiative not only provides immediate aid but also encourages ongoing engagement among community members affected by substance-related challenges.

            "In recent months, residents of Upstate New York have observed what they believe to be unidentified flying objects (UFOs) soaring through the night sky. A total of 16 distinct UFO sightings were recorded throughout July alone, sparking curiosity about extraterrestrial visitation among locals. The sightings occurred during summer evenings when the combination of clear skies, extended darkness, and tranquil rural settings provided ideal conditions for observing unusual aerial activities.\nOne witness described seeing 'a silent, bright white orb' hover briefly before moving southeast out of sight, while another noted 'two rotating reflective objects' positioned diagonally against one another in the evening sky. Another account detailed three colorful, pointed UFOs merging together before disappearing behind clouds, coinciding with a sudden return of local birdlife.\nThe phenomenon attracted attention beyond personal observations, leading individuals to document their experiences via photographs and video recordings. One particular incident involved a 'glowing object' captured on film that resembled a spacecraft upon closer inspection. Such documentation contributes to the growing body of evidence collected by organizations like the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC).\nNUFORC serves as a repository for UFO-related encounters within New York State, offering a platform for those interested in sharing their own experiences. The center emphasizes its status as a non-governmental, non-profit entity dedicated to compiling and analyzing reports of unexplained aerial phenomena.\nAs interest continues to mount regarding these mysterious sightings, many remain skeptical yet intrigued by the possibility of encountering visitors from distant worlds.

            "A local entrepreneur and restaurant owner is looking to open a unique restaurant concept — an all-halal food hall — a short drive north of Disney Springs.Somita Enterprises LLC is behind an application to Orange County that calls for a 5,600-square-foot facility, according to a report in GrowthSpotter. The concept, going by the working name “Lake Buena Vista Food Hall”, would be built on a roughly 1.4-acre property at 11581 S. Apopka Vineland Rd. across the street from the Islamic Center of Orlando, which operates a mosque and a private school.Halal food, which uses ingredients that are permitted for consumption according to Islamic law, incorporates a variety of meats such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat meat, and most seafood. Most notably, pork and alcohol are not considered halal.The halal food hall would be located next to the Islamic Center of Orlando. (Orange County Property Appraiser)The LLC is associated with Tahir Ansari, best known as [one of the original owners of the now-closed The Skull Kingdom on International Drive, who owns a franchise location of The Halal Guys in East Orlando. The restaurant features a Mediterranean-inspired menu, with beef gyro, chicken, and falafel sandwiches and platters among the food offerings.However, halal encompasses a diverse selection of cuisines. Earlier this year, Sanford’s Masjid Al Hayy mosque organized a halal food festival in celebration of Eid. Vendors in attendance included Chaat House (Indo-Chinese), Big Backs BBQ (East African fusion), Dave’s Hot Chicken, Maya Thai Cuisine, Ox’s Way (vegan), Koyla Pakistani BBQ, The Halal Brisket, Melt n Dip, Chef Abu Rimas, The Burger Jawn, and more.It’s not clear yet what dishes would be served at the proposed food hall, but application materials suggest that the location could feature multiple vendors and kiosks. A site plan calls for outdoor seating adjacent to the one-story building, along with 25 surface-level parking spaces.Orlando-based Intram Investments owns the land. Randy Hodge, Intram’s Executive Vice President, told GrowthSpotter that Somita Enterprises has a ground lease for the property but declined to comment further. The one-story building would be located on S. Apopka Vineland Road and would have surface-level parking. (Site plan provided by Florida Engineering Group)Numerous restaurants and cafes have opened in the same area over the last couple of years. Among them are Eggs Up Grill, McDonald’s, Cold Stone Creamery, Planet Smoothie, Dutch Bros Coffee, Mango Mango Dessert, and more located on the western portion of Unicorp National Development’s O-Town West development at the southwest corner of S. Apopka Vineland Road and Daryl Carter Parkway, just north of the proposed food hall.To the south, a retail building with tenants such as @ The Diner, Piezoni’s Pizza, and Pio Pio Vineland, opened in 2023 at 11895 S.

            "In a move aimed at catering to Muslim consumers seeking halal-certified foods, Somita Enterprises LLC has submitted an application for a new all-halal food hall called 'Lake Buena Vista Food Hall'. Situated approximately five miles north of Disney Springs, the proposed establishment aims to become a culinary destination within the Orlando area. According to reports from GrowthSpotter, the 5,600-square-foot facility is envisioned to occupy a space spanning about 1.4 acres on South Apopka Vineland Road, strategically placed just across the street from the Islamic Center of Orlando's mosque and educational institution.\nHalal food adheres strictly to Islamic dietary laws, prohibiting the use of pork and alcoholic beverages; instead, it offers a wide array of permissible meats such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat, and various types of seafood. The diversity of halal cuisine extends beyond these staples into numerous regional flavors and cooking styles.\nSomita Enterprises LLC, led by Tahir Ansari—a notable figure previously involved with The Skull Kingdom and owning a franchise of The Halal Guys—aims to introduce a range of halal-friendly dishes through its innovative food hall concept. While specific menus remain under wraps until finalization, early indications point towards a mix of traditional Middle Eastern fare alongside other international halal specialties.\nAdjacent to the Islamic Center of Orlando, the proposed food hall promises not only to serve halal meals but also to foster community engagement during significant cultural celebrations such as Eid. With potential vendor participation mirroring past events like Sanford’s Masjid Al Hayy mosque's halal food festival earlier in the year—which featured an eclectic lineup ranging from Indo-Chinese chaat houses to vegan eateries—the Lake Buena Vista Food Hall may well replicate this vibrant atmosphere.\nRandy Hodge, Intram Investments’ Executive Vice President, confirmed ownership of the land earmarked for development. Although he did not delve deeper into specifics regarding leasing arrangements between Somita Enterprises and Intram Investments, it's understood that Somita holds a ground lease granting them operational rights for the project.\nAs preparations continue toward bringing this ambitious venture to fruition, stakeholders anticipate that the Lake Buena Vista Food Hall will enrich Orlando's gastronomic landscape by introducing a dedicated space where Muslims—and those interested in halal cuisine—can enjoy authentic and lawful dining experiences.",

            "The New York Giants have had one week of training camp. After six practices, here’s everything I’ve learned about the team so far: Nabers healthy ... for now The Giants had their first major injury scare when wide receiver Malik Nabers got tangled in a scrum while blocking on a run play Tuesday. Nabers landed on his shoulder and remained down for a moment before walking to the sideline under his own power. Advertisement Nabers promptly left the practice field, accompanied by head trainer Ronnie Barnes. Barnes returned to the field a short time later and immediately provided an update to coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen. While Giants fans held their collective breath, early indications are that Nabers is fine. Perhaps he’ll be limited in upcoming practices as a precaution, but there are no concerns about the shoulder. The importance of Nabers can’t be overstated. He has been even more of a focal point in camp than he was last season, when he set a rookie record with 170 targets despite missing two games. Connection building 📈 Training Camp highlights streaming now on GiantsTV, free on Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV or in the Giants mobile app pic.twitter.com/YM4pkUyCEU — GiantsTV (@GiantsTV) July 27, 2025 Just as he was a year ago, Nabers has been unstoppable early in camp. He has quickly developed chemistry with Russell Wilson. The veteran quarterback’s patented moon-ball should lead to more big plays for Nabers, who was targeted 20-plus yards downfield on 17.6 percent of his targets last season. George Pickens, who was Wilson’s top receiver in Pittsburgh in 2024, had 29.5 percent of his targets 20-plus yards downfield. The key will be keeping Nabers healthy, as he missed the spring with a lingering toe injury. Nabers said he’s managing the injury, which hasn’t limited him much so far. A healthy Nabers gives the Giants an elite playmaker defenses must game-plan to stop. If Nabers isn’t in the lineup, the offense will be devoid of firepower. Walking wounded Nabers joined a growing list of injured wide receivers. The most significant injury was the torn Achilles suffered by Bryce Ford-Wheaton on Sunday. It was a brutal blow for the third-year receiver who suffered a torn ACL in the 2023 preseason that wiped away his rookie season. Ford-Wheaton established himself as a key special teamer last season despite playing through a shoulder injury that required postseason surgery. He had just worked back from that injury when he suffered the season-ending Achilles tear. Advertisement Wan’Dale Robinson must be wondering how he got on the bad side of the football gods. The 5-foot-8, 185-pound Robinson was on the receiving end of a nasty collision with outside linebacker Brian Burns on Friday. The 6-foot-5, 250-pound Burns was running full speed chasing tight end Greg Dulcich downfield. As Dulcich cut, Burns ran directly into Robinson, causing a collision so violent that it could be heard from the sideline. Both players remained down for a few minutes before slowly walking into the team facility with trainers. Remarkably, neither player was seriously injured, although Robinson required liquid stitches to close a gash on his lip. Burns returned to full participation Monday after missing one practice, while Robinson returned Sunday. He immediately was the victim of friendly fire again, as safety Dane Belton inadvertently kneed Robinson in the thigh. Robinson was held out of Monday’s practice and then participated only in individual drills Tuesday, as the team is taking a cautious approach with the minor injury. A make-or-break third season for Jalin Hyatt is off to an inauspicious start. He caught a back-shoulder fade from rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart for a touchdown on the second day of camp, but he didn’t finish that practice. Daboll said Hyatt “cramped up” and was “a little tight in the lower body.” Hyatt hasn’t returned to full participation in four practices since. His absence doesn’t figure to extend much longer since he has been participating in individual drills, but it’s alarming that he has now been sidelined by two lower-body injuries since adding significant weight this offseason. He was shut down during minicamp in June with an apparent hamstring injury. Hyatt still has the inside track to the No. 4 receiver job, but it’s hard to see a major role for him if Nabers, Robinson and Darius Slayton are healthy. Missing practice time only makes it more of an uphill climb for Hyatt to earn more snaps. Here’s the recording: https://t.co/RDn8BXeB8W https://t.co/bAkFbWmdZP — Dan Duggan (@DDuggan21) July 30, 2025 Next man up? Wide receiver injuries have led to calls for the Giants to sign Gabe Davis, who visited the team in May. Davis, who was cut by the Jacksonville Jaguars in May, has a history with Daboll and Schoen from their time together in Buffalo. The Giants have remained in contact with Davis, who spoke last week about his interest in joining the team in an interview with Kay Adams . The hitch is that Davis still isn’t healthy from the torn meniscus he suffered in November — he told Adams he’s roughly 80% recovered — so any potential signing won’t happen until he’s cleared. Advertisement In the short term, the beneficiaries of the depleted wide receiver depth chart are players already on the roster. Ihmir Smith-Marsette, who wants a bigger role on offense after exclusively serving as a returner last season, has stepped in for Robinson in the slot. Undrafted rookies Beaux Collins and Dalen Cambre have also seen an uptick in first-team reps. Though it’s easy to get caught up in practice catches when evaluating which wide receiver will make the team, it will be more instructive to note who ranks highest on the special teams depth chart. Ford-Wheaton’ 286 special teams snaps are what need to be replaced. Cambre could have the edge because he was a special teams ace at Louisiana, but Collins has big-time pedigree (Clemson/Notre Dame). Collins is the early favorite among the undrafted rookie receivers to earn a roster spot. Star watch Left tackle Andrew Thomas was on a side field rehabbing with trainers Tuesday. It was the second time during camp Thomas has been spotted as he recovers from the Lisfranc injury he sustained in October. The Giants are taking a deliberate approach to ramping up Thomas, aiming to have him ready for Week 1. The plan has been for Thomas to see live action before the opener. It would be encouraging if he is activated from the physically unable to perform list next week so he’ll be on track to participate in joint practices and/or the second preseason game against the Jets on Aug. 16. The Giants’ other indispensable player, defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence, has been a limited participant throughout camp. He typically only plays a handful of reps in team periods, and on Tuesday, he sat out during live work completely. It’s unclear if the reduced workload is due to Lawrence’s return from a dislocated elbow or if the team is just managing the reps for a valuable veteran. It’s likely a combination. Like with Thomas, the Giants’ only focus with Lawrence needs to be having him healthy for the season because the drop-off from both players to their backups is vast. Advertisement Change is good The early vibes surrounding Evan Neal’s transition to guard have been positive. He spoke about the position change, which he had opposed earlier in his career, for the first time on Tuesday. He sounded like a player who understands his career is in the balance and is eager to embrace this fresh start. The upbeat disposition matters with Neal, who hasn’t responded well to being the target of scrutiny during three disappointing years at right tackle. But more important is that some of the 6-foot-7, 340-pounder’s weaknesses have been mitigated by moving inside. Neal’s struggles with balance and footwork were exposed on the edge by dynamic pass rushers. Those weaknesses still could pose a problem at guard, but his massive frame is better utilized inside. Though he won’t be effective as a pulling guard, Neal should be a force on double-team blocks in the run game. His length should help him in pass protection, although he’s still fine-tuning the area that has been his greatest weakness. Neal has rotated at right guard with Greg Van Roten, who has taken the majority of first-team reps. Neal will have a legitimate shot at winning the job if the encouraging early signs continue into preseason games and joint practices. That would give the Giants more upside in the starting lineup and improve their depth, as the reliable Van Roten could serve as the top backup at all three interior positions. Corner competition It initially seemed like a motivational ploy when Deonte Banks and Cor’Dale Flott rotated at starting cornerback opposite Paulson Adebo in the spring. Banks had been handed a starting job as a first-round pick in 2023 and maintained that role despite a dismal second season plagued by effort issues . So, there was a notion that perhaps the staff was making Banks “earn” the starting job by giving Flott reps. Advertisement But a week into camp, it’s clear there is a legitimate competition for the starting job. Banks and Flott have split time evenly throughout the first six practices. Each day, they alternate which player begins the day with the starters (Flott was the starter on the first day of camp) and then they split first-team reps. It’s unclear how long the rotation will last, as neither player has separated himself in the competition. Banks typically traveled with the opponent’s No. 1 receiver last season, which exacerbated his struggles. Perhaps the Giants will ask the same of Adebo when they start game-planning for opponents, but he has lined up almost exclusively at left corner during camp. That’s not a surprise since Adebo lined up at left corner on 98.3 percent of his snaps on the perimeter during the past three seasons with the New Orleans Saints. If the Giants are going to keep Adebo in his comfort zone, that means the No. 2 corner will draw matchups with the likes of Terry McLaurin, CeeDee Lamb, AJ Brown, DJ Moore, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Justin Jefferson this season. The team needs Banks or Flott to elevate their play to give the Giants a chance in those matchups. Waiting on Wilkins? When Lawrence has been in the lineup, Rakeem Nunez-Roches and Roy Robertson-Harris have most often been the other starting defensive linemen in the base defense. Elijah Chatman has also worked heavily with the starters. Nunez-Roches started 15 games last season, and the Giants signed Robertson-Harris to a two-year, $9 million contract in the offseason, so it’s not a surprise they’re at the top of the depth chart. It’s more surprising that Chatman is ahead of third-round pick Darius Alexander and veteran free-agent signing Jeremiah Ledbetter. The defensive tackle group behind Lawrence is a concern, especially with run defense being a weakness the past two seasons. The natural speculation is that the Giants could target Christian Wilkins to form an Avengers-style front seven. Advertisement The Giants were interested in Wilkins, who is close friends with Lawrence from their days together at Clemson, in free agency during the 2024 offseason. But the Giants instead directed their funds to an extension for Burns after acquiring him in a trade with the Panthers. Wilkins signed a four-year, $110 million contract with the Raiders. That partnership lasted just over a year, as the Raiders shockingly cut Wilkins last week . The Giants certainly would have interest in Wilkins under the right circumstances, but nothing is imminent due to various factors. Most importantly, Wilkins’ health is unknown. Disagreements over the status of Wilkins’ foot, which he fractured last October, led to his release. The sides are battling over the remaining $35.2 million guaranteed money in Wilkins’ contract. If the Raiders can void those guarantees, Wilkins could be out of the Giants’ price range. And then there are locker room issues that raise questions about how he’d fit in New York. It’s unlikely Wilkins will sign with the Giants — or any team — until there are more answers in this saga. Trade talk The Giants traded tight end Darren Waller and a conditional 2027 seventh-round pick to the Dolphins for a 2026 sixth-round pick on July 1. The condition on that pick is tied to Waller’s production, according to a league source. If Waller tallies 50 or more catches, the Giants keep the pick. If Waller, who retired in June 2024, fails to reach that threshold, the Giants will send the pick to the Dolphins. Simply getting a condition applied to the pick was a win for the Giants, who were elated to get anything for Waller. Even if he returns to form, the Giants will gladly exchange a sixth-round pick next year for a seventh-round pick in two years for a player who was out of the picture. The Giants now have three sixth-round picks in the 2026 draft — they acquired another by trading defensive lineman Jordan Phillips to the Cowboys last August. The surplus of sixth-round picks could be useful in the coming weeks if the Giants want to make a trade for a veteran to upgrade their depth.

Despite initial concerns, it appears Nabers may continue playing without limitations. His performance remains crucial; last season, he achieved a rookie record with 170 targets. Nabers has established strong chemistry with quarterback Russell Wilson, leading to numerous deep passes.

            "In the opening week of its annual training camp, the New York Giants faced a potential setback when wide receiver Malik Nabers encountered an injury during a scrimmage. The incident occurred when Nabers became entangled in a scrum while attempting to block a running play. He fell onto his shoulder but managed to walk off the field independently. Head trainer Ronnie Barnes attended to him briefly before returning to coaching duties. Early reports suggest that Nabers did not suffer serious harm from the fall, though some level of caution might limit his participation in subsequent sessions.\nNabers' role within the Giants' offense cannot be understated. Last season, he shattered rookie records by amassing 170 targets—a testament to his reliability and skill. This year's camp has seen Nabers forge an impressive connection with veteran quarterback Russell Wilson. Their partnership promises to yield substantial gains, particularly given Wilson's penchant for long throws, known as 'moon-balls.' In comparison to George Pickens, another former Pitt receiver, Nabers showed remarkable efficiency, catching 20-plus yard passes on nearly half of his attempts last season.\nThe well-being of Nabers is paramount for the Giants' success. Injuries such as the ones plaguing other players—like Bryce Ford-Wheaton's torn Achilles following a previous ACL tear—underscore the fragility of player rosters. Ford-Wheaton's career trajectory took a dramatic turn due to these setbacks, highlighting how critical each player's fitness is to the overall strategy against formidable opponents.\nAs the Giants navigate through their training camp schedule, they remain hopeful that Nabers will stay out of harm's way. His presence elevates the team's offensive capabilities significantly, making him an essential figure whose continued availability would greatly benefit the Giants' prospects.",

        content:
            "When Barcelona face FC Seoul in their second friendly of pre-season in the South Korean capital on Thursday, fans will notice the La Liga champions wearing a unique new kit. Barca’s away strip for the coming season is a collaboration with Kobe Bryant’s brand, which is part of the Nike empire. The late NBA icon’s logo replaces the traditional Nike swoosh on the right side of the player’s chest, while the shirt’s gold and purple detailing is a nod to Bryant’s playing days with the Los Angeles Lakers, whose uniforms feature those colours. But what is the link between Bryant and Barcelona? Let us explain. What does Barcelona’s new away shirt look like? The shirt’s colours are described as “clear team gold with touches of Persian violet and black” by the club’s official website. These take inspiration from the colours of the Lakers, although the Lakers’ shade of gold is actually closer to yellow. The shorts are black with further “Persian violet” details. The Nike swoosh has been replaced by the Kobe Sheath logo on the chest, and the shirt’s fabric has a snakeskin texture in keeping with Bryant’s Black Mamba nickname. Bryant played for the Lakers from 1996 to 2016. What is the Kobe brand? Bryant first signed with Nike in 2003, and the most recent, long-term agreement was reached between his estate and Nike in 2022. The sheath logo debuted the same year he signed with the company, on the fourth version of Nike’s Air Huarache 2K5 shoes. It was designed by Nike’s Eric Avar, who has worked on many of Bryant’s series of footwear, and was said to have been inspired by samurai warriors and their swords. Advertisement Has the Kobe brand ever partnered with a sports club or organisation before? U.S. college basketball teams such as the Kentucky Wildcats, Oregon Ducks and USC Trojans have worn Kobe-branded shoes and apparel. But this is the first time the former NBA star’s brand has collaborated with a football team. It is most well-known for its performance basketball shoes, which are some of the most popular in the NBA. Barcelona signed a new contract extending their partnership with Nike in December, which club sources at the time said was worth a total of €1.7billion over the following 14 years . The previous deal had been due to expire in 2028. The official announcement of the collaboration with the Kobe brand said it is set to continue through to the 2027-28 season. What is Bryant’s legacy? Selected by the Lakers with the 13th pick in the 1996 NBA Draft, Bryant went on to become the Black Mamba, giving himself the nickname after watching Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill movies. A black mamba is a species of snake used as a code name for the films’ protagonist, a deadly assassin played by Uma Thurman. In 2014, Bryant told American magazine The New Yorker , “This (Black Mamba) is a perfect description of how I would want my game to be. “If I create this alter ego, so now when I play, this is what’s coming out of your mouth. It separates the personal stuff, right? You’re not watching David (the main character’s name in the 1970s TV show; it’s Bruce in the comics and films) Banner — you’re watching the Hulk.” Bryant’s work ethic became known as ‘Mamba Mentality’, used by Nike in its marketing around his line of products. In one of many examples of this mentality, Bryant’s former Lakers team-mate Caron Butler once told the Duncan Robinson YouTube channel of going through Bryant’s “blackout” workout — exercising so hard you see stars — the day after Bryant had signed a new seven-year, $136million contract with the Lakers in 2004. Advertisement He won three consecutive NBA titles (2000-02) with the Lakers and was one half of a formidable duo with Shaquille O’Neal. Bryant also won two more titles in 2009 and 2010 with Pau Gasol, who played for Barcelona’s basketball team before going to the NBA. Additionally, Bryant won Olympic gold medals in 2008 and 2012. Bryant was a hugely popular player, but after a sexual assault allegation in 2003, he was dropped by many of his sponsors, though not by Nike. Prosecutors dropped the case a year later when the alleged victim told them she was unwilling to testify. He denied the allegations but later apologised — saying he understood that the woman did not view their sexual encounter as consensual, while he did — and settled a civil case out of court. Bryant also told The New Yorker in 2014 that he had created his Black Mamba alter ego to cope with the fallout from that case. He retired in 2016 at age 37 after 20 seasons with the Lakers, scoring a huge 60 points in his final game. Bryant was killed, aged 41, in a helicopter crash near Los Angeles in January 2020, along with one of his four daughters, 13-year-old Gianna, and seven other people. What is Bryant’s connection to Barcelona? According to Barcelona sources, speaking anonymously as they did not have permission to comment publicly, the collaboration has special significance given Bryant’s emotional connection to the club. Bryant lived in Italy between the ages of six and 14, as his father played professional basketball there, and developed a passion for soccer. He later adopted Milan and Barcelona as his two favourite teams in that sport. He spoke Italian and Spanish, having learned the languages during his years in Europe. Between 2006 and 2015, Bryant visited the Barca squad four times, both in Spain and during their pre-season tours in the United States. In 2017, he spoke to ESPN about the friendships he developed with Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi — and the moment the Brazilian introduced him to the latter during one of the club’s summer trips. “I think Messi must have been 18 at the time, 17 maybe,” he said. “Ronaldinho called him over and said, ‘Kobe, I want you to meet the player who is going to be the greatest player who ever lived’.” Bryant won his last two NBA titles alongside Barcelona native and close friend Gasol. The Spaniard wrote the foreword for Bryant’s book The Mamba Mentality: How I Play. According to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo , Bryant turned down an offer to extend his career by joining Barcelona’s basketball team after leaving the NBA. Advertisement Barca beat the Lakers, featuring Bryant and Gasol, 92-88 in a pre-season game in 2010. Their team included a young Ricky Rubio, who had a 12-year NBA career with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Utah Jazz, Phoenix Suns and Cleveland Cavaliers. Barca’s footballers held a minute’s silence at training following Bryant’s passing, and their fellow Spanish sides Real Madrid and Atletico paid their respects with a silence before a derby fixture a few days after the fatal crash. Former Barcelona forward and NBA fan Neymar held up two fingers on one hand and four on the other in a tribute to Bryant — he wore the No 24 jersey for the Lakers — after scoring for Paris Saint-Germain in a match against Lille a few hours after news of his death emerged. What other connections do Barcelona have to basketball? Barcelona’s basketball team play in the cross-continent EuroLeague, widely considered to be the sport’s best league after the NBA. Pau Gasol and his younger brother Marc, a 2019 NBA champion with the Toronto Raptors, are two of the club’s most famous youth products. Jabari Parker, the second pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, was a Barca player for the past two seasons before departing this summer. The United States’ ‘Dream Team’, consisting of megastars such as Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Charles Barkley, famously won Olympic gold at the 1992 Games in Barcelona, helping popularise the sport and showcase its best players on a global stage.

            "In a groundbreaking move that merges American basketball culture with European soccer, FC Barcelona announced a new away kit adorned with Kobe Bryant's signature design. The iconic LA Lakers legend passed away recently, leaving behind not only memories of his illustrious career but also a legacy that continues through his brand collaborations. For the upcoming match against FC Seoul during their pre-season tour in South Korea, fans will witness the La Liga giants donning attire that pays homage to Bryant's storied past with the Lakers.\nThe new away kit features a distinctive 'Kobe Sheath' logo supplanting the classic Nike swoosh on the left chest area of the players' jerseys. The color palette draws heavily from the Lakers' historic hues—gold and purple—with additional Persian violet accents gracing the sleeves and collar. The shorts complement these shades, maintaining a sleek black base interspersed with subtle hints of Persian violet.\nThis sartorial tribute extends beyond mere aesthetics; it represents a deep connection forged when Kobe Bryant joined forces with Nike back in 2003—a relationship that culminated in a landmark agreement last year between his estate and the athletic giant. The Kobe Sheath emblem made its debut alongside the fourth iteration of Nike's Air Huarache 2K5 sneakers, conceived by designer Eric Avar under Bryant's influence.\nWhile collegiate basketball programs across America have previously sported Bryant-branded gear—from Kentucky Wildcats to USC Trojans—the football world now joins them in celebrating his impact. Notably, this marks the inaugural instance where Bryant's brand has extended into football territory, diverging from its primary focus on high-performance basketball footwear.\nBarcelona's commitment to Nike remains unwavering, having secured an extensive renewal of their sponsorship deal earlier this year, ensuring continued support until 2034. Valued at an impressive €1.7 billion, this arrangement underscores the mutual respect and admiration shared between the Spanish club and one of basketball's greatest icons.",

            "McBride, 25, is coming off his first Pro Bowl appearance and 1,000-yard season and is one of the NFL's top paid tight ends.",
        content:
            "GLENDALE, Ariz. — The Cardinals’ $80 million tight end walks to the side of the stadium tunnel in beat-up, old flip flops, slides his back down against the concrete wall and plunks all 250 pounds of himself to the ground. “Is it OK if we sit?” It’s both an unfussy posture and location for Trey McBride to talk about how much money he’s just made, how his entire life and that of his family (including many siblings and pets) changed the moment he signed the four-year, $76 million extension with Arizona that solidifies McBride as a face of the franchise. Advertisement That contract also places him atop the earnings at his position (just under tenured San Francisco tight end George Kittle), saying as loudly as McBride’s 1,146-yard previous season that the 25-year-old is also one of the ascending young faces of the NFL. Shortly after he signed the contract in April, McBride stood at the lectern in the Cardinals’ stadium — cameras, lights, the whole thing. But on this late-July day he chooses to sit on concrete next to the tunnel, feeling its coolness against his back and its stability underneath him as he continues to process how everything he ever quietly dared to dream about has come true. At times, McBride’s raw emotion surges across his face and he swipes at his eyes with one tattooed finger, pausing now and again to collect himself but not because he’s embarrassed. He worked harder than anyone could know to become this player. He doesn’t care if a stranger sees how much that means to him. “Just keep going,” McBride says he would have told the younger version of himself, knowing what he does now. “Trust the process. That’s really what I’ve done. I’ve just continued to take every single day (and) try to become the best version of myself and just know that my time is coming. “You don’t get a lot of opportunities in this league. When it does come, you’ve got to take it and run.” McBride’s arrival in Arizona as a second-round pick in 2022 wasn’t glamorous at first. But his timing, plus his mastery of his position over the last three seasons could not have intersected more perfectly with that of Cardinals offensive coordinator Drew Petzing. Petzing, 38, comes from Mike Shanahan/Gary Kubiak’s offensive system (via Minnesota), then from Kevin Stefanski’s version of that system (via Cleveland). Petzing and the Browns’ offensive staff thought about different conflicts to create for defenses using do-it-all tight end Austin Hooper and what the future might be once then-rookie David Njoku emerged. Petzing often asked defensive players “what kept them up at night” when playing against one or two tight ends who could block and catch the ball. Over time, some of those conversations found their way into Arizona’s playbook once Petzing arrived in 2023. Advertisement Then, the Cardinals were rebuilding. But McBride had found his momentum. He spent the 2022 season mostly on the back side of plays, digging out blocks in support of lead tight end and veteran teammate Zach Ertz while quietly hungering for more. In 2022, Ertz caught 47 passes while McBride had just 29. In 2023, under new head coach Jonathan Gannon and his offensive coordinator, Petzing, that flipped. Ertz went on injured reserve that November, and McBride became the lead target of the entire offense with 81 catches for 825 yards, 31 more catches than even the Cardinals’ top receiver at that time, Marquise Brown. The team went 4-13 for a second consecutive season, but everything had changed for McBride. Ertz later signed with Washington, formalizing McBride’s No. 1 spot not only in the tight ends room, but also in the offense. “I wanted to be in that role,” McBride said. “I wanted to be that featured player. I really took it in every day, trying to be the best player I could be and trying to grow.” Petzing, who used two tight ends or 12 personnel at a 20 percent rate in 2023 (15th most in the NFL) and 13 personnel or three tight ends at a league-leading 11 percent rate (per TruMedia), hammered down harder on that identity with McBride at its center. The Cardinals increased their 12 personnel usage to nearly 30 percent in 2024 (10th), and again led the league with a 15.6 percent rate of 13 personnel. McBride, always the single tight end when in 11 personnel and always the leader in the heavier packages, accounted for 30 percent of all receptions by the Cardinals’ offense in 2024 (111). Arizona improved to 8-9. McBride was a Pro Bowler and also became the first tight end in NFL history with at least 221 catches in his first three seasons. “When the ball is in the air, he’s gonna catch it,” said tight end Elijah Higgins. “I think that’s the thing that’s most special about Trey, is he just comes down with the rock. He just makes things happen, and that’s what good football players do.” Advertisement In McBride, Petzing has found a player through whom he can build literally any concept. “He allows us to be whatever we want to be, whenever he’s in the game,” said Petzing. “Stretching the field? Great. He can do it. Match up one-on-one versus man (coverage)? He can win. Underneath a zone defense? Catch-and-runs? Feeling space? Making decisions? He’s really talented.” Single-high coverage? Look out for some version of “Far Cross”, which is McBride’s favorite route in Petzing’s playbook. He’ll run a dozen or so yards upfield before breaking at a long angle toward the opposite sideline from where he started. McBride likes it because he wants to see if he can beat the safety with speed. He doesn’t think most people believe he’s as fast as he is. “And (he) allows us to do all of that without tipping our hand or letting people know what we’re trying to do,” Petzing said. Petzing and the offense have a saying: “Multiple for them, simple for us.” It means they want to build counters and complementary plays to an initial look, all out of the same look, so that a defense is indecisive about what it will do after that first play. In doing this out of heavier personnel concepts like 12 and 13, they can make an already-physical gap scheme running game (featuring powerful running back James Conner) even more taxing to stop. Because Petzing has McBride and teammates Higgins and Tip Reiman, the Cardinals can stay in their heavier personnel whether the play is run or pass, leaving even more for the defense to guess. As an every-down blocker and the lead receiver by volume, McBride has to know more about this offense than almost any other player on the team. “Tight end in this offense ... what we require them to understand mentally is not quite the quarterback, but it’s probably the closest thing,” Petzing said. McBride has to understand as much about the intricacies of the blocking schemes and front structures as the starting offensive linemen (except from every alignment, not just one position). He has to know his releases, the coverage he’ll see at the top of his routes and what that may present as pre-snap. McBride’s teammates along the offensive line say that trusting he’ll know where to be in his blocks and also “selling out” for as physical a collision as possible in turn allows them to commit further to their own blocking. If they know their help (McBride) will be in the correct place on their block, explained center Hjelte Froholdt, a lineman is able to get his full body and vision into it instead of also partially manning his peripheral. Advertisement “He embraces the ‘suck’,” said Froholdt. “... That’s something that we can respect.” To get through all of this information and technical work, practice is all-important for McBride, who pushes so hard in that setting that he often has to swap out gloves in the middle of it because his first pair is soaked through with sweat to the point where they make the football wet, too. Tight ends coach Ben Steele calls him “Wild Man”. Practice is also a bit of a useful nightmare for Gannon and defensive coordinator Nick Rallis. Gannon’s defense, which improved last season to 14th in DVOA from its bottom-of-the-league status in 2023, is in a way a reflection of Petzing’s offense. Many plays, including shifts and rotating coverages and a variety of pressures, come out of indiscernible pre-snap looks. It is a perfect creative playground against which McBride can practice being anywhere, on any given play, and both sides are challenged in the process. Out of that spawns new ideas for all of the coaches. And some well-meaning frustration. Like the offense, the defense has to install certain plays and get in functional reps. “ ‘Nick, you better put two (defenders) on him or he’s gonna wreck every practice,’ ” recounted Gannon, grinning. “ ‘I can’t do that all the time.’ ‘Yeah, I know. Well, we’re getting killed.’ ... “Typically in the numbers game of defense versus offense, there (are) more tools to take away receivers than there are tight ends, truthfully. Now, there’s ways you can do it but it’s taking away from the structure, typically, of the defense. “I’m glad we go against such a good player like that, because we’re gonna see ’em in our division (and) scattered throughout the league.” In Sunday’s practice inside the stadium, McBride glided through red zone seven-on-sevens and collected quarterback Kyler Murray’s first two passes, including one for a touchdown. He leaped to dunk through the goalposts, but pulled the ball at the last second and thudded it against the crossbar with one hand. The force of McBride’s arrival rattled the uprights, sending the orange flags at their tops fluttering. (Illustration: Will Tullos / The Athletic ; photo: Mitchell Leff / Getty Images)",

            "In a display of humility mixed with pride, Trey McBride stepped out onto the sunbaked streets of Glendale, Arizona, clad only in worn-out flip-flops. With each step towards the Cardinals' stadium, McBride carried the weight of his new reality—a staggering $76 million contract extending through 2026—making him one of the most lucrative tight ends in the NFL. This financial milestone came shortly after McBride had already cemented his status among the elite with a Pro Bowl selection and a record-breaking 1,146 receiving yards during his rookie season.\nMcBride chose to sit beside the stadium tunnel rather than stand before the media spotlight once again. As fans gathered around, they were met with a man who seemed unphased by fame yet visibly moved by success. 'Is it OK if we sit?' McBride asked casually, signaling his desire to share personal reflections away from prying eyes.\nThe conversation turned introspective as McBride recounted the years spent honing his craft into becoming a formidable force within the sport. He spoke candidly about the sacrifices made along the way—the countless hours dedicated to perfecting technique and building resilience—and acknowledged the support network behind him, including family members and friends.\nDespite the accolades and wealth, McBride remained grounded. He emphasized trust in one's abilities and dedication to self-improvement. 'Just keep going,' he'd advise those watching, encapsulating his philosophy throughout his ascent in football.\nMcBride's rise was anything but ordinary; selected in the second round of the 2022 draft, he quickly became a pivotal figure in head coach Kliff Kingsbury's offense. Under offensive coordinator Drew Petzing, whose background includes stints with renowned coaches like Mike Shanahan and Gary Kubiak, McBride found synergy that propelled him forward.\nAs McBride sat there amidst the desert heat, absorbing the coolness of the concrete beneath him, he represented more than just a sports icon. He embodied perseverance, ambition, and the relentless pursuit of excellence—all qualities that resonated deeply with fans and aspiring athletes alike.",

            "Two of our writers discuss the pros and cons of restricted free agency, and whether it should be changed.",
        content:
            "Most offseason business is done for NBA teams, with a few notable exceptions. Golden State’s Jonathan Kuminga , Brooklyn’s Cam Thomas, Philadelphia’s Quentin Grimes and Chicago’s Josh Giddey , all restricted free agents, remain unsigned. With no other teams dangling offers, the teams and their players are in protracted staring contests, with no end in sight. Advertisement Here at The Athletic , we’ve looked into each individual case. However, writers Tony Jones and Eric Koreen had some thoughts on restricted free agency as a concept. Here, they discuss its merits, whether it is a relic of a past economic reality and if it can be tweaked. Koreen: I don’t want to delve right into hot-take artistry, so let me say: The Oklahoma City Thunder won the Alex Caruso-Giddey trade. Caruso played an essential role in helping the Thunder win their first title. Winning the title is the whole dang point. But Giddey was solid as a Chicago Bull. To close the season, he averaged 21.2 points, 10.7 rebounds and 9.3 assists in 19 games after the All-Star break, shooting 45.7 percent on 4.3 3s a game, attempting 5.8 free throws per game. Did he rescue the Bulls from their fate as Play-In fodder? He is but one man, so no. But he was good! Now he is one of The Restricted Four. None of them are all-stars, but they are all young with utility. As RFAs, their teams can wait for other teams to give them offer sheets, with the right to match. The only team with significant cap room this summer, the Nets, declined to use their space in that way (more on that later). So now, the four can negotiate with their teams, hoping to come to a long-term deal, or sign a one-year qualifying offer — in Giddey’s case, $11.1 million, the richest of the bunch — allowing them to become unrestricted free agents in 2026. I feel most for Giddey this year because he was useful in Oklahoma City and figured out how to contribute there. Still, he is stuck in this scenario. To review quickly, restricted free agency was introduced after the 1999 lockout, a reaction to young players reaching unrestricted free agency too quickly for the owners’ liking. (The rookie scale itself came into effect in 1995, a reaction to deals such as Glenn Robinson’s 10-year contract after being the first pick in 1994). It was just another tool to tie a player to the team that drafts him, with the team holding more of the power. Advertisement By now, we understand that the best young players are going to get paid, regardless. Perhaps teams will find common cause with lesser rotation players, hoping to offer long-term certainty in exchange for an annual discount. Let’s start big, Tony: Do you like the way restricted free agency works? Jones: I like the way it works, as it gives franchises — specifically small-market franchises — control up to as many as nine years, which allows them to retain the star talent they drafted. But RFA looks like a casualty of this new collective bargaining agreement. Teams are more hesitant, understandably so, given the penalties, to spend a bundle of money. They are more careful about who they are spending their money on, and that’s frozen the RFA market. In years past, Giddey’s performance might have earned him that big offer sheet. The same goes for Grimes, who emerged as a starting-level shooting guard over the past season. Of course, context is everything. We are talking about four guys who are affected here. Not one of them has affected winning on a grand scale. When you watch Golden State play, there is a reason Kuminga, for all of his talent, is on the bench so often. If you watch the Nets play, it’s clear why Thomas doesn’t have a market in RFA. Grimes and Giddey proved to be good players. But they also broke out primarily in March, when at least the Sixers were doing everything they could to lose every game possible and when many teams in the league were simply counting down the days to summer vacation. I maintain that putting up numbers in March requires context. That being said, Grimes projects to be important to what Philadelphia does this season. Giddey projects to be important to what the Bulls do. Thomas and Kuminga? They have yet to prove they contribute anything but their own statistics at the NBA level, and that’s why their markets don’t exist. Advertisement Is this something you agree with, Eric? Koreen: There is a lot to consider there. I think their markets don’t exist for a few reasons. I’m not going to ferociously defend their games, and I partly agree with your last statement. Teams will not bend over backward to sign those guys, with reason. However, the unique context of this summer, with only one team operating with cap space, is a huge factor. That the Nets were looking to rent that space out to get future picks basically eliminated the cap-space teams. This is where I go back to yelling about rewarding teams for not trying to win, as I did in March . If the Nets were not guaranteed a top-five pick if they end up as the worst team in the league, they would surely be more aggressive in trying to sign players who could help them next year. Instead, they did financial favors for Denver and Atlanta for picks, not caring a lick about the short-term. I digress. With the way teams are building out their future payrolls — look at all the expiring money the Clippers have in 2027, for example — the death of free agency, including RFA, might have been overstated. This year might be an extreme example of a trend and not a vision of the future. However, I want to quibble with something you said: that it is good teams can “control” their drafted players for so long. I get it. I was a teenage Raptors fan when Tracy McGrady left Toronto after three seasons, robbing us of years of T-Mac/Air Canada Eastern Conference supremacy. But our colleague David Aldridge wrote earlier this year in favor of abolishing the draft . I don’t agree with him, but I also think that effectively tying a player to his franchise for so long, given that the one-year qualifying offer doesn’t come close to matching his long-term earning potential, is inherently unfair. I have some ideas about how to rework things, but do you think this system is fair to the players (keeping in mind they make millions of dollars to play basketball; this is all in context of the system)? Jones: Fair isn’t the word I would use. I do think that because of the new CBA, where teams have to be vigilant on who and what they are spending their money on, the system is tough. This has become so much more of a business. In the past, you could drop $20-25 million on a starting shooting guard such as Grimes, who I think contributes to winning, and if need be, trade the contract a year or two down the road. Those days are over. And that’s what makes the RFA market difficult. We are also seeing what the NBA values and doesn’t value in terms of skill. Thomas and Kuminga are both extreme ball-in-hand players. If they don’t have the ball in their hands, they aren’t effective. This is what they have put on tape in four years. In the NBA, if you are a ball-in-hand player, you’d better be one of the best 20 offensive players in the league. Otherwise, you need role-playing skills. You need to be a 3-and-D guy, a floor general or a rim protector. Advertisement What makes me feel for Grimes is that he is versatile enough to play all across the backcourt and can be a role player. What I like about Giddey is that he can run an offense, although he is similar to Thomas and Kuminga in that he largely needs the ball in his hands to be effective. The business world and reality of the RFA market, combined with what the players have proven to be as NBA players, is why we are seeing the freeze. I believe if any of the four did more than very rarely flash star potential, even in this difficult market, somebody would have moved enough mountains to create the space for an offer sheet. Or their own teams would have. What are some potential resolutions to the business side of this? Koreen: I agree with your assessment of things in these cases. If the CBA limits how teams plan, that will especially be the case with RFA, when your aggression isn’t even guaranteed to get you a player. And no, none of these guys are certain difference-makers even at a top-40 level. Beyond that, the CBA is bargained collectively. Both sides agreed to this. I can only get so worked up about it. Still, I can’t get the Kuminga/Golden State issue out of my mind. The Warriors don’t want Kuminga, and Kuminga doesn’t want to be in The Bay. Yet, the Warriors weren’t willing to forgo extending him a qualifying offer ($7.9 million for 2025-26), the mechanism that keeps him restricted instead of unrestricted. Thus far, Kuminga doesn’t want to accept it. Given what we know about the risks of an 82-game season on the body, I don’t blame him. I’d want to lock in a longer deal, too. The problem lies with the qualifying offer, then. Right now, it is 135 percent of your previous contract, in most cases. Of course, you have a window, during the offseason after the player’s third year, to agree to an extension and avoid any sort of free agency following his fourth year. So, let’s keep that — except if the two sides don’t come to a deal, the qualifying offer is 225 percent of the previous salary (or, make up your own formula, like the NFL’s franchise tag ), which makes the one-year deal more enticing for the player and more problematic for the team. Maybe with the raised qualifying offer, you extend the window for teams to exclusively negotiate with their pending RFAs. Essentially, make the team have to make a hard choice about the player’s future, with more paths to unrestricted free agency. Advertisement I get the importance of teams having vehicles to keep their rosters together, especially as that seems more fleeting with the new CBA. But I also think tying a player to a team like this is, frankly, wrong. These teams are being cowardly here, or “protecting the asset” in business-speak. Do you believe in the player or not? It feels like players deserve an extra smidgen of leverage, especially if they wind up in a situation that doesn’t work for them. Jones: You made a terrific point here, Eric, and it’s a point worth exploring. For all of the warts displayed by some of the players we are talking about, the teams are essentially holding on to them just because they can , and that’s wrong. So, maybe it’s time for some tweaks to RFA. These four teams have cost the players money, or at least taken away the chance for them to get that payday elsewhere. So, here is what I propose: If a player goes into restricted free agency, that player has a good portion of the offseason to either re-sign with his team or sign an offer sheet from another team. If none of that has happened by, say, Aug. 15, the player has two options, and the team has two options. The team can either keep the qualifying offer on the table or rescind it. The player can either accept the qualifying offer, if the team still has it on the table, or go straight into unrestricted free agency. That, I believe, will keep the basics of RFA in place. It will give teams a great runway to keep their guys, but it will also prevent teams from doing what we are seeing now, which is essentially freezing the market. How does that sound? Of course, there will be tweaks, but is the premise a solid one? Koreen: The biggest reason I’m against that is our vacation time, Tony. Do you like taking time off? Dragging free agency into August in a real, codified way? Guh! I have trouble reconciling that with how free agency actually works, because it would still put players in a rough position if the qualifying offers were rescinded. It’s unlikely rival teams would hold off on their main activity until then, so will a competitive market exist at that point, even if the players become unrestricted? In that case, the qualifying offer would have to be a mutual option, where if either side opts into it, it becomes guaranteed. Even in that case, I’d favor putting the qualifying offer at a higher percentage of the previous salary. Advertisement As we spoke about, we’re talking about a small number of players in what might turn out to be an outlier of an offseason. With all the different team motivations at play, though, the NBPA should have RFA in mind next time the CBA is up for negotiation — if not as a priority, then as something that can be tinkered with a little.

        ai_content:
            "In the world of professional basketball, particularly within the NBA, the topic of restricted free agency has been under scrutiny following recent seasons where several promising talents have found themselves in limbo. Among these are Jonathan Kuminga of Golden State, Cam Thomas of Brooklyn, Quentin Grimes of Philadelphia, and Josh Giddey of Chicago—all classified as restricted free agents yet to secure contracts despite their potential impact on the court.\nAt The Athletic, journalists Tony Jones and Eric Koreen delved deep into the intricacies of restricted free agency—a mechanism designed post-1999 lockout to prevent young talent from jumping ship prematurely while giving teams leverage through matching rights against incoming offers. This system allows players like Giddey, who contributed significantly during his time with the Oklahoma City Thunder before becoming part of 'The Restricted Four', to seek new opportunities potentially leading to lucrative short-term deals or longer commitments.\nGiddey's performance since joining the Thunder—averaging 21.2 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 9.3 assists across 19 games—is commendable; however, it does not overshadow the broader debate about the efficacy of restricted free agency today. While it once served as a strategic buffer between rookies' early career decisions and full-fledged unrestricted freedom, critics argue it's increasingly misaligned with current sports economics and player development trajectories.\nKorean's perspective highlights the delicate balance between rewarding existing contributions and fostering future growth. Despite Giddey's impressive stats, including a remarkable 45.7% three-point success rate and consistent scoring efficiency, he's merely one piece in a larger puzzle involving multiple talented individuals caught in similar situations.\nThe narrative extends beyond individual cases to encompass systemic considerations—the Nets' decision not to engage financially with the restricted free agents exemplifies a missed opportunity amidst available cap space. As discussions continue around possible reforms, the core question lingers: Is restricted free agency still serving its original purpose, or is it time for recalibration?\nThis ongoing conversation reflects a sport constantly grappling with change management—from salary caps to draft strategies—and underscores the need for adaptive policies that align with contemporary realities. Whether through adjustments to existing rules or entirely novel approaches, the goal remains clear—to ensure fair play for athletes and competitive integrity for franchises.",

            'This story was produced by the State College regional bureau of Spotlight PA , an independent, nonpartisan newsroom dedicated to investigative and public-service journalism for Pennsylvania. Sign up for Talk of the Town, a daily newsletter of local stories that dig deep, events, and more from north-central PA, at spotlightpa.org/newsletters/talkofthetown . BELLEFONTE — In 2019, a state agency bucked tradition when it moved the start of rifle deer season to the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Moving it back two days — from the longtime Monday start — was controversial. Some hunters criticized the move as an unnecessary shift, while others welcomed the extra time in the woods. A Pennsylvania legislator thinks he’s found a compromise that will work for both rural communities and hunters who want more flexibility. Legislation introduced by state Rep. Eric Davanzo, R-Westmoreland, would create two start dates for the regular firearms deer season, determined by game commissioner districts. Using Interstate 80 as a rough dividing line, the bill would have northern counties return to the traditional Monday, and have those to the south begin on the Saturday before the holiday. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}})}(); The bill was referred to the state House Game and Fisheries Committee in late June but has yet to receive a vote. A split approach to the season opener, Davanzo told Spotlight PA, balances the needs of hunters in rural areas — where the sport is so integral to the culture and economy that most schools are closed on traditional opening day — and people in other parts of the state that still have school or work Monday but want more time in the woods. “I didn’t design this to be a Saturday bill or a Monday,” he said. “This was really about the longevity of hunting.” Modernizing the state’s hunting laws has been a slow process in Harrisburg, marked by a divide between tradition-minded hunters and those pushing for more flexibility and time in the woods. The latter hope updates can help keep the sport alive, especially among younger people. The Saturday opener was one such change. Lawmakers approved an update in 2019 that allowed hunting on three Sundays each year. And last month, Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, signed legislation that lets the Game Commission decide which Sundays to include when setting season dates, ending Pennsylvania’s near-total ban, despite opposition from nonhunters. Some rural businesses said the shift from Monday to Saturday has hurt their bottom lines because hunters spend less time — and money — in their communities. Prior to the vote, Game Commission studies showed most hunters preferred the traditional Monday opener, 2 to 1. Then-Commissioner James Daley pointed to those data during an April 2019 public meeting . Another survey of lapsed hunters, he noted, found that only a small number would buy a license with a Saturday opener. But in the end, the hope that a Saturday opener would boost hunting license sales won in a 5-3 vote. Daley later resigned, citing the new date as the reason . Brookville Area Chamber Director Jamie Popson told Spotlight PA some small businesses in Jefferson County — gas stations, grocery stores, bars and restaurants — took a hit after the change. Representatives from chambers in Mercer, Clearfield and Lackawanna counties told Spotlight PA that members haven’t expressed concerns about the shift from Monday to Saturday. In 2021, after three seasons with a Saturday opener, the Game Commission contracted with Responsive Management , a survey research firm, to gauge opening day preferences among hunters. Sixty percent of respondents supported the Saturday opener, with hunters noting work obligations Monday. Opposition to the change was higher among hunters 55 and older and those who went to hunting camps. Travis Lau, a Game Commission spokesperson, told Spotlight PA in an email that Davanzo’s proposal takes away the state agency’s decision-making authority. He also noted that a split approach “would be unlike any other hunting season” because it relies on commissioner districts — nine in total, each with multiple counties — instead of the 22 wildlife management units, which are based on habitat and can cut across county lines. The Pennsylvania Federation of Sportsmen and Conservationists understands the concept behind the legislation, Mike Kriner, a lobbyist for the organization, told Spotlight PA. But it’s the Game Commission’s job to annually set hunting season dates in consultation with their wildlife and conservation experts and hunters, he said — not lawmakers. “Maybe the workweek changes 50 years from now, and it makes more sense to have a season opener on a Wednesday, the Game Commission can make that change every year, right?” Kriner said. “It takes a long time — having been in Harrisburg since 1991 — even when the Legislature wants to get something changed, it takes them a long time to do it.” SUPPORT THIS JOURNALISM and help us reinvigorate local news in north-central Pennsylvania at spotlightpa.org/donate .

This dual-date system intends to cater to the unique circumstances faced by different segments within Pennsylvania's diverse landscape—acknowledging the profound significance of hunting practices in rural economies, often intertwined with educational calendars, alongside accommodating individuals residing outside these zones who may prefer additional leisure time outdoors during weekends.\nIntroduced into the state House Game and Fisheries Committee towards the end of June, the measure remains pending deliberation despite its potential implications for hunter participation rates and wildlife management strategies.

They married in 1951.She began teaching English and history at Manchester High School and was later named vice principal. She subsequently transferred to the Carroll County Board of Education and was its director of pupil services. She retired in 1979.“She saw the potential in students that they might not recognize themselves,” said a friend, Martin K.P. Hill. “Dolly was a special lady. She had high expectations of everyone, but she accepted everyone as they were. She would do anything to improve a life.“If you knew Dolly, you wanted to do her proud,” Hill said. “She was a giving, respected individual.”After retiring the first time, Mrs. Snyder was elected to McDaniel College’s board of trustees. In 1998, she became the first woman to serve as the board’s vice chair. In 2023, she was named trustee emerita.“My mother had a tremendous number of friends,” said her daughter, Lyn Graham. “She was respected in our community.”“Dolly was ahead of her time. She was highly placed in education before women had jobs like hers,” said Joan Develin Coley, former McDaniel College president. “She had a way of getting along with people.”Related ArticlesSteven Allen, federal prosecutor known for high-profile drug cases, diesMary Grivakis Mallis, first lady of Boumi Temple, dies at 101Robert Seurkamp, former Xerox executive and Notre Dame of Maryland fixture, diesDoug Roberts, longtime Baltimore stage and screen actor, diesRichard Mark Alter, real estate executive and former lacrosse standout, diesIn 1993, Mrs. Snyder received McDaniel’s Joseph R.

        content:
            'We can no longer ignore what’s going on in Gaza. We shouldn’t be afraid to speak up about it, either. It is portrayed in the Sun Sentinel with a picture of a withered, starving child in Gaza. I can’t understand how Netanyahu, who is Jewish and understands what happened in the Holocaust, allows this to go on. I understand that a terrible injustice was done to the Israeli people by Hamas and we need the hostages returned. But killing 50,000 people and starving women and children should not be the way to go about it. It has been going on for way too long. I am not anti-Israel, but I am against purposely starving men, women and children. It is inhumane, and as an American I do not want to support this. This cruelty needs to stop. There must be another way to get the hostages returned. We need to feed these people. Diane Miller , Plantation A front page Sun Sentinel headline, July 24: Israel blockades causing starvation. What we should ask is, who’s responsible for this mess in Gaza? Hamas is the government in Gaza, yet its leadership is ensconced in Qatar, not Gaza, and it could care less that its citizens are starving. Aren’t they the responsible party? They could end this disaster quickly: Release the hostages. The news media and many Western countries want to blame Israel for this horrific situation. Lest we forget, Israel was attacked by Hamas. Its citizens were kidnapped, raped, beheaded or put in ovens to die — war crimes for sure. Hamas has governed Gaza since 2007. What have they done to better their citizens’ lives? Why doesn’t any other Arab country want to help? No Arab country wants to take in Gazan refugees. Is that Israel’s fault too? Stop the “Blame Israel” campaign. Start writing headlines and speaking truth that Hamas is totally and unequivocally responsible for the deaths and destruction of Gaza and its people. Nancy-Jo Feinberg , Boca Raton Every day is a story in the Sun Sentinel of supposed indiscriminate killing of Gazans by Israeli Defense Forces. But now, it’s on the front page. The stories state that Israel hasn’t provided evidence of diversion by Hamas of food or of Hamas being imbedded in the civilian population, implying that Israel is lying. Better journalism would tell the Israeli side and leave it at that. If Hamas hadn’t invaded, butchered and raped Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, there would be zero casualties in Gaza. Their refusal to admit defeat, disarm and leave Gaza indicates their lack of concern for the citizenry there. Mark Keller, Miami The attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6 was a riot. It was fermented for the good of Trump. It was no “walk in the park.” Those who were found guilty by a jury or pleaded to crimes were aware that they faced justice for criminal acts against the republic. Their actions were to further a political purpose — as were their pardons. Israel is wrong for its treatment of the people of Gaza. Hamas must be destroyed, and the IDF has done so in large measure. The remnants of Hamas could have been hunted down as the American military has done to terrorists around the world. Israel wishes more than the destruction of Hamas. It wants the Palestinians out of Gaza. Trump’s proposals only serve to give Netanyahu room for acts that should be defined as crimes against humanity and genocide. It seems the atrocities the Jews suffered allow such acts against the innocent. World history is a pendulum. Power shifts over time. There should be concern for the future when any disenfranchised people gain power. Sometimes it allows even far more atrocities, revenge and hatreds that only ensure repetition.

            "Sharpe's seven-year career, specifically the three seasons with Brett Favre and Mike Holmgren, was among the best stretches in NFL history.",
        content:
            "When thinking about Sterling Sharpe, one of the first people that comes to LeRoy Butler’s mind is the legendary bodybuilder Lee Haney. “Intimidation,” Butler, the Hall of Fame Packers safety, says of Sharpe. “When he’d work out, he’d work out by the window, so when you go past the window, you would see him. Everybody else got on Packer-issued shirts and shorts. He had this whole Lee Haney outfit. I’m curling like 20-pound weights, and he’s curling 100-pound weights.” Advertisement Butler once asked Sharpe why. Sharpe told him it was “because Jerry Rice, Cris Carter, they don’t look like this. (It’s) to let y’all know, ‘I’m the man.’” On Saturday, Sharpe will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame despite playing just seven seasons in the NFL. Only 10 players enshrined spent less time playing professional football than the former Packers wide receiver, whose career was cut short by a neck injury suffered in 1994. Sharpe has waited a quarter-century since he first became eligible for the Hall of Fame to receive his gold jacket. Sharpe was not your prototypical 6-foot-4 X receiver, but rather a 6-foot bulldog. His career played out much like his build: Short, but exceedingly impressive. To those who watched him, the premature end to his career prolonged a day that would have otherwise come long ago. “If he hadn’t gotten hurt, he would’ve been a first-ballot Hall of Fame (selection),” says Mike Holmgren, the Packers’ head coach for Sharpe’s last three seasons. “That’s the only explanation I could give. I had the privilege of coaching Jerry Rice and being around great receivers, and Sterling’s right up there with those guys. He was special.” Butler, a teammate of Sharpe’s for five seasons, took his proclamation a step further. “I tell people all the time, if he didn’t get hurt, he’d be the G.O.A.T.,” Butler said. “The Jerry Rice discussion wouldn’t even be there. Sterling would be the G.O.A.T.” Statistically, Butler’s claim has merit. Sharpe played seven seasons, all with the Packers, after Green Bay drafted him seventh overall in 1988. He made the Pro Bowl five times, All-Pro First Team three times, led the NFL in catches three times, topped the league in touchdown catches twice and ranked first in receiving yards once. During those seven years, Sharpe’s 595 receptions ranked second in the NFL — 25 fewer than Rice, already an established Pro Bowler when Sharpe was a rookie. Sharpe’s 65 touchdown catches were second (behind Rice’s 91), and his 8,134 receiving yards third (behind Rice and Henry Ellard). Advertisement Brett Favre stepped in as his quarterback in 1992, and the pair set the NFL ablaze. Only five wide receivers since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger have won the triple crown (leading the league in receptions, receiving yards and touchdown catches); Sharpe achieved the feat in his first year with Favre and Holmgren. Over three seasons with Favre, which would be Sharpe’s last in the NFL, he had a league-leading 314 catches (20 more than Rice) and 42 TD catches (four more than Rice), and his 3,854 yards ranked third behind Rice (4,203) and Michael Irvin (3,967). Butler says Sharpe knew how to separate himself before the whistle even blew. He said Sharpe would roll down his socks so opponents would see how jacked his calves were. “And the reason you gon’ know I pulled ‘em up is you gon’ see those white and green socks going past everybody,” Butler recalled Sharpe saying. What Sharpe lacked in height and speed, he made up for in build and fearlessness. “He was so much more physically fit than the other guys,” Holmgren said. “Receivers are tall and lanky a lot of times. He was built. He was strong. He ran routes, he was smart, yards after the catch, he had good speed to go deep, he had everything you wanted.” Holmgren recalled playing the Raiders, a team known for their hard-nosed style, and a cornerback lined up across from Sharpe in press-man coverage near the Packers’ sideline. “Sterling was not like a lot of receivers,” Holmgren said. “He came straight out at the guy, hit him, just blasted him, knocked him into the sideline where I was standing, and then ran his route. We threw the ball to him. I was going, ‘Oh, man, I don’t see that happen too often.’” Sharpe thought defensive backs would play scared if they saw someone built like him charging toward them. “He already had you in the head thinking that I’m bigger than you, stronger than you, and I look better than you,” Butler said. Sharpe didn’t miss a game in seven years before his neck injury, which he suffered in the penultimate game of the 1994 season, against the Falcons, while blocking. He even played in the regular-season finale against the Buccaneers, catching nine passes for 132 yards and three touchdowns, but he re-injured his neck ahead of the playoffs. Testing revealed two loose vertebrae, an injury that ended Sharpe’s career before age 30, and as the Packers were ascending with Favre and Holmgren. He missed out on a Packers Super Bowl title, which came two seasons later, and perhaps myriad individual feats that might have placed him in the same breath as Rice and, at the very least, in the Hall of Fame more than two decades ago. Sharpe has said he often hears people talk about what he wasn’t able to accomplish. When he finally does don his gold jacket, it will be about what he did. (Top photo: RVR Photos / Imagn Images)",

            "Sterling Sharpe, affectionately dubbed 'the bulldog' for his tenacious playstyle, might have reached the pinnacle of NFL greatness—G.O.A.T.—if fate hadn't intervened. A neck injury during practice in 1994 prematurely ended what many believe was a stellar career. Sharpe's tenure with the Green Bay Packers spanned seven impactful seasons, where he thrived alongside legends Brett Favre and later Mike Holmgren.\nSharpe's physical prowess extended beyond the field; his dedication to fitness mirrored that of renowned bodybuilder Lee Haney. This commitment translated into intimidating presence—a trait Sharpe himself attributed to standing out against contemporaries like Jerry Rice and Cris Carter.\nDespite a relatively brief stint in the NFL compared to other Hall of Famers, Sharpe amassed numerous accolades throughout his career. Drafted seventh overall in 1988, he quickly established himself as a force within the league. Five Pro Bowl appearances, three All-Pro First Team selections, leadership in total receptions, and top-tier performance in touchdown catches underscored his exceptional talent.\nLeRoy Butler, a fellow Hall of Famer and longtime teammate, expressed no surprise at Sharpe's eventual induction. 'If he didn't get hurt, he'd be a first-ballot Hall of Fame selection,' Butler stated. 'He was special.' Mike Holmgren echoed these sentiments, acknowledging Sharpe's place amongst the elite receivers he's coached.\nStatistically speaking, Butler's assertion holds weight. Sharpe's achievements speak volumes about his skill set and influence on the sport. As he joins the ranks of football immortals today, discussions continue regarding how injuries shape legacies and whether Sharpe's potential remained unrealized because of them.",

            "Soon to be the oldest head coach in NFL history, Carroll is bringing the same fire and passion to Las Vegas that he's always had.",
        content:
            "HENDERSON, Nev. — Every member of the Las Vegas Raiders gathered together in a tight circle Sunday morning following practice, with head coach Pete Carroll pushing orders from the middle. Then, from deep inside the scrum, a football soared straight into the air, followed by two players’ rising hands until one victoriously swatted it back into the mosh pit. Carroll had orchestrated a competitive jump-ball drill between two players who had gotten into a shoving match earlier in practice. They went three rounds, and the entire team whooped and hollered the whole time. “After you have a jump ball,” Carroll smirked, “you can’t be mad anymore.” The 73-year-old coaching legend emerged, somewhat surprisingly, from a quiet year of reflection to take over the Raiders. When Carroll and the Seattle Seahawks parted in 2024, those close to him believed he still had ample coaching years left in the tank, although no one really knew how he’d play it. Advertisement As it turned out, Carroll wanted some time to himself before determining the desire was very much still alive. “I had to let the dust settle a little bit and get a feel for what that was like being out (of the league),” Carroll told The Athletic recently. “Once that cleared, the pursuit of the passion was too obvious.” With Carroll, the passion is understood . He went 181-131-1, including the playoffs, while coaching the New York Jets, New England Patriots and Seahawks over 18 seasons, highlighted by a victory in Super Bowl XLVIII. He also led USC to a 97-19 record with two national championships, one of which was later vacated. Carroll, who will become the oldest head coach in NFL history this season, has thrived throughout his career with sharp charisma and an unmatched ability to maintain a high level of excitement in the building. Of course, his defensive acumen has always been an asset, as well. It was all so clear with the jump-ball competition. It was simple on the surface, but it served as a perfect way to give the players a charge as they pushed through the grind of training camp. Such things are a daily occurrence around here, even if it’s in the form of a now-routine transitional practice period when the players bound over blocking pads as coaches and trainers jump around with heavy bags, swinging ropes and yelling as Rage Against the Machine blared in the background. It was a quick stretching drill that looked more like a scene from “Mad Max: Fury Road.” With the Patriots, there were stories of Carroll canceling practice and packing the players onto buses with kegs on their way to bonding events. With the Seahawks, Carroll opened the mornings with 3-point shooting contests. And to be sure, there are likely thousands of other comparable examples. “I only know one way to do it,” Carroll said. “I’m not doing anything different than I did when I was coaching at (Pacific) a million years ago. I’m just having fun coaching and making sure I affect as many people as I can. ... I can’t ask them to go if I’m not going, so I bring it every day.” Advertisement But what is Carroll’s pursuit? He’s tied for 17th with 170 regular-season victories and is one of three coaches to win both a national championship and Super Bowl. Carroll, who turns 74 in September, has a secure legacy and could have kicked up his feet in retirement without anyone batting an eye. Carroll just isn’t much of a feet-up kind of guy. “You’re either competing or you’re not,” he said. “I just like battling. I like competing. That’s exactly what it is. The passion was alive and well. In chasing it, we wound up here with the Raiders.” Carroll’s challenge in Las Vegas is real. The Raiders finished 4-13 last season, their worst record in a decade, and they haven’t won a playoff game since 2002. They’ve fired three general managers and three head coaches since 2021, so the roster will need quite a bit more time to be constructed under the vision of Carroll and GM John Spytek. Carroll is ready to compete, though. He was rarely far from a football field during his year off, watching games from junior varsity in high school to the NFL, where he has plenty of friends with various teams. His son, Raiders assistant quarterbacks coach Nate Carroll, was with the Carolina Panthers in 2024. His other son, Raiders offensive line coach and run game coordinator Brennan Carroll, was at the University of Washington. Naturally, Pete Carroll had rooting interests from coast to coast. Go figure, a football lifer like Carroll even found new ways to appreciate the game while he was between jobs. “There are a million (ways),” Carroll said. “I’ll give you an example about effort, how hard guys play the game or how hard they don’t play the game. Snaps last about six or seven seconds. It’s not that long to strain. I watched it from the kids all the way through into the league. They don’t play as hard as they could. I made it a real emphasis for us in this camp and with this team. ... We’re going to play as hard as we’re capable.” Let’s get it! #RaiderNation pic.twitter.com/kp7mgR3mzq — Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) July 23, 2025 Not that Carroll has ever lacked for energy, but his message has backing. He’s still running around the field as much as possible, putting his arm around a cornerback’s shoulders while giving a lesson about the previous play or darting up to a tight end to slap his chest after a nice adjustment led to a quality catch. Advertisement Carroll most certainly still looks like himself on the field. “It made it a really successful offseason because I could see things differently than I’d seen them before. You have to get away,” Carroll said. “I tried to make this a really profitable year, as well. I feel like it’s been invigorating. You see things a little differently. You have a clear mind.” (Photo: Ethan Miller / Getty Images)",

Known for his charismatic leadership and exceptional defensive strategies, Carroll remains a pivotal figure in American football. His latest demonstration of skill came during a post-practice session where he organized a spirited jump-ball contest involving two players previously involved in a scuffle. This event not only reinvigorated the team's morale but also exemplified Carroll's knack for fostering unity and determination amidst rigorous training schedules.",

            "\"In a series of baseball events across various levels of Minor League Baseball as of July 30, 2025, several teams experienced notable performances that contributed to their standings. In one highlight, Brendan Jones delivered a crucial moment for the Somerset Patriots when he smashed a two-run homer in the seventh inning, propelling his team to a 5-3 victory over the Richmond Flying Squirrels. This pivotal play came after a sacrifice fly earlier in the game, which put Somerset ahead before Jones' decisive contribution.\nThe Hudson Valley Renegades also celebrated success during these matches, clinching a 4-3 triumph against the Wilmington Blue Rocks. Cade Smith played a significant role in securing this win with his pitching prowess; despite allowing four hits and three runs, his ability to strike out six batters led to a win for the Renegades.\nMeanwhile, the Tampa Tarpons faced challenges throughout their doubleheader against the Clearwater Threshers. They suffered a loss in Game 13 with a final score of 5-12 but bounced back later in the day to secure a narrow 5-1 victory in Game 14. Key players like Juan Matheus and Roderick Arias were part of the lineup, each facing their own struggles and successes within the day's action.",

        content:
            "“If we don’t split now, it’ll be much harder later.” How many relationships reach that ledge, where one person says something to that effect to their partner? Many, that’s how many. Too many to quantify. In “Together,” the droll, fiercely well-acted codependency horror movie, Alison Brie delivers the news to Dave Franco, when their characters, Millie and Tim, a put-together schoolteacher and a coming-apart musician, have gotten a little too close in tricky, arguably unhealthy ways. But is it too late? Are they stuck with each other? The Australian writer-director Michael Shanks makes his feature debut here, and for a movie so ardently devoted to body horror — a literalization of this couple’s particular dynamic — it has an unusually sprightly sense of humor. Brie and Franco, as you may know, are a married couple, and “Together” uses their ease with each other’s bodies and verbal rhythms to highly useful ends. Even when Shanks hits the primary theme of his movie a little too insistently, the actors are vivid throughout. Brie, especially, is spectacularly effective in every emotional register, in the keys of D (Distress), E (Eh what’s going on with our suction-lips?) and C (Commitment is all). After a murky, fragmented prologue indicating another couple’s recent disappearance, “Together” gets down to its cautionary tale of city folk giving the country a try. Like “Se7en” and various other genre thrillers, this one’s intentionally dislocated so that it could be any big city — though probably New York, or possibly London— and any charming little town a couple of hours away. (The movie was filmed near Melbourne and Victoria, Australia.) At a going-away party for Millie, whose new teaching job requires her and Tim’s move to a nice little burg on the train line, Tim suffers a mistimed and painfully public proposal of marriage. Millie is thrown for a loop, and the pause Millie takes before responding, two, maybe three seconds, lands like a day and a half. Brie is a wizard of timing and naturalistic cadence, and the film’s strategic introduction to their characters works like a flop-sweat charm. After the move-in upstate, things seem initially better yet very quickly worse. The new house has an unexplained odor. Tim, insecure and itchy for a sense of career purpose, commits to a band tour, while Millie befriends a genial faculty colleague (Damon Herriman) who lives down the lane. The woods near Tim and Millie’s house are lovely, dark and deep, plus strange: Remnants of a ruined chapel of some kind have settled into the mucky earth. More suddenly, these two fall down into a literal and metaphoric well of trouble, a hidden entrance to an underground cavern laden with secrets as well as a pool of clear water that looks safe enough to drink. From there “Together” escalates in cannily paced fashion, thanks to director Shanks’ forward momentum and editor Sean Lahiff’s destabilizing visual rhythm. After their underground discovery the couple isn’t the same. The teacher down the lane offers a sympathetic ear and some insights to Millie, who confesses her doubts about Tim, who cannot leave her alone for long. The neighbor responds with advice from Plato’s “Symposium” and Aristophanes’ theory (as written by Plato) of two human beings completing each other, aka the “Jerry Maguire” principle. “Together” relies on much blood and some severing of body parts, true, but from one angle it’s a romcom with an all’s-well capper that “Jerry Maguire” didn’t have the nerve to try. Filmmaker and screenwriter Shanks goes a bit far with his completion-theory thesis, with the Spice Girls’ “2 Become 1” on the soundtrack and perhaps one too many examples of the physical extremes undergone by Millie and Tim. The effects, however, are pretty terrific, especially in the neighborhood of the eyeballs. I’ve probably said too much, but it’s in the elegantly wrought teaser trailer, and while “Together” has a very different authorial voice (male) than last year’s “The Substance” (female), “Together” tells its fantastical tale a lot more efficiently. It works, I think, largely because Shanks has the guts to write a male protagonist (though Millie has the edge, on the page and in the performance) who is no hero, no villain, just a mass of garden-variety insecurities, all too reliant on his partner for a sense of direction. Maybe these times have made it easier for male filmmakers to lay off redemption arcs and stalwart heroics, and lean into chaos and the humor of despair. But an actor always has the last word in a character’s life, and here the key actor is Brie. While the combination of Brie and Franco serves the story well, in nearly every moment they share on screen she’s the one who makes urgent sense, both dramatic and comic, of every new relationship obstacle. On paper, Millie’s doubts conveniently fade when the story requires as much, and that’s very much a product of the man who wrote and directed this film. On the screen, with Brie, you buy it. And unless your ick tolerance is low to low-medium, you’ll likely roll with the merry ick of “Together.” “Together” — 3 stars (out of 4) MPA rating: R (for violent or disturbing content, sexual content, graphic nudity, strong language, and brief drug content) Running time: 1:42 How to watch: Premieres in theaters July 31 Michael Phillips is a Tribune critic.",

        ai_content:
            "In the cleverly crafted horror-comedy 'Together,' director Michael Shanks explores the complexities of a seemingly perfect relationship through the eyes of Alison Brie and Dave Franco. The film follows Millie, played by Brie, a dedicated schoolteacher, and Tim, portrayed by Franco, a self-discovering musician. Their idyllic life together faces turmoil following Tim's spontaneous marriage proposal at a farewell gathering—a moment that leaves Millie stunned into silence.\nShanks' directorial debut delves deep into the nuances of codependency within a romantic partnership, using body horror not just as shock value but as a metaphor for the couple's entanglement. The narrative unfolds against the backdrop of a quaint rural setting, contrasting sharply with the bustling metropolis they left behind—a choice reminiscent of classic thriller tropes seen in films like 'Se7en.'\nAs Millie grapples with the sudden shift in dynamics post-move, she confronts an array of domestic mysteries including an inexplicable smell permeating their new home. Meanwhile, Tim struggles with insecurities about his artistic pursuits and seeks validation outside their shared space. Brie's portrayal of Millie captures the essence of distress, confusion, and commitment with remarkable finesse across different emotional landscapes.\nDespite Shanks' occasional heavy-handedness towards the central motif of bodily transformation, the performances remain compelling. The chemistry between Brie and Franco shines through, leveraging their real-life marital bond to enhance authenticity. Filmed around Melbourne and Victoria, Australia's picturesque locales serve as the ideal canvas for this modern-day cautionary tale set in either New York or London.\n'Together' ultimately questions whether love alone can sustain a relationship amid growing discomfort and unease. As the story progresses, viewers witness the unraveling of Millie and Tim's connection under the strain of external pressures and internal conflicts. With its unique blend of genres and sharp wit, 'Together' offers more than just scares—it provides insight into the fragility of human connections.",

        content:
            "It’s trials time. The 2025 World Athletics Championships are just over six weeks away. Starting today (Thursday) and ending Sunday, the top U.S. athletes will assemble at Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore., for the USA Track and Field Outdoor Championships to determine who goes to Tokyo in September. Every nation is permitted to send a maximum of three men and three women per discipline to worlds. The exception to this rule is one bonus spot for wild cards. Advertisement First introduced in 1997, these are automatic qualification byes given to current individual world champions. Olympic gold medalists from Paris do not get an automatic wild card; guaranteed entry goes to the world champions from Budapest in 2023. Eight Americans have wild cards: Noah Lyles (100- and 200-meter); Grant Holloway (110-meter hurdles); Sha’Carri Richardson (100m); Ryan Crouser (shot put), who is injured and will not compete this week; Chase Jackson (shot put); Laulauga Tausaga (discus); Katie Moon (pole vault); Brooke Andersen (hammer throw — she was the leading athlete on the continental tour, which earns a hammer-specific wild card). For everyone else, there are two other primary ways to qualify, which World Athletics calls its “dual pathway.” The conventional route is to produce a qualification standard-performance (within the qualification window: Aug. 1 2024 to Aug. 24 this year) and then finish top three at trials. Both parts are required. If a wild-carded athlete finishes top three, then fourth place gets their spot. The other qualification method is world ranking. Rankings are determined by a points-score average (World Athletics standardizes performances into points) of an athlete’s five best results in a 12-month period; for 5,000m and 3,000m steeplechase, it is an average of three performances, and two for 10,000m, heptathlon and decathlon. World Athletics considers the rankings as a clearer, more consistent indication of talent compared to the standard, which an athlete only needs to hit once. Take the women’s high jump, where only eight women have the entry standard (1.97m). The sole American in that is Rachel Glenn, but with 36 spaces to be filled, 13th-ranked Vashti Cunningham, the U.S., No 2, should qualify by position and without needing the standard. Here’s what to watch for at the championships, which will be streamed in the U.S. on NBC/Peacock, with on-demand coverage available at USATF.TV. Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone: 400m but no hurdles In her quest to become the greatest one-lapper, Olympic 400-meter hurdles champion and world-record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone has switched to the flat. She missed worlds two years ago because of a knee injury, so she has to race to qualify for Tokyo. Her 50.37-second winning time in Paris last August smashed her own world record, as the 25-year-old defended her 400m hurdles Olympic title from Tokyo. Advertisement She raced the 400m flat at the 2023 U.S. trials when she had the wild card (after winning the 400m hurdles at the 2022 world championships). Two years ago, she ran 48.74 for 400m, which ranks 12th all-time and makes her the second-fastest American woman — behind Sanya Richards-Ross (48.70), whose national record dates back to 2006. McLaughlin-Levrone won over 400m at the Prefontaine Classic at Hayward Field on July 5, with a season’s best time of 49.43. She has raced more this year than in other seasons, doubling over the 400m flat and hurdles at two Grand Slam Track meets, but is by no means a certainty to make the team. Three other American women (Aaliyah Butler, Gabby Thomas, Isabella Whittaker) have better times than McLaughlin-Levrone this year over 400m. Thomas, however, is racing the 100m and 200m. The 400m flat sets McLaughlin-Levrone up better for the relays: she has raced the 4x400m at the past four global championships and ran the fastest leg in last summer’s Olympic final (48.60), where the U.S. women won gold in a North American-record time (3:15.27). The 400m flat heats, semifinals and final all take place one day earlier than the respective 400m hurdles rounds in Tokyo. Lyles and a 200m title defense “I’m still the national champion. I don’t believe in giving up titles,” Lyles said of the 200m before the London Diamond League in mid-July, where he ran 10-flat for his 100m season opener. “I earned that title and I need to race it. Somebody needs to take it from me if they want it. We’re going to run every round.” Lyles won the 100m and 200m at trials last year, with his 19.53 a 200m trials record. He holds the three fastest times for that distance at Hayward Field, where he set the American record (19.31s) at the 2022 world championships. He is registered for the 100m but will likely not race it. Before London, he said: “We don’t see a reason to double because we feel that would be too much in four days. It might change.” Lyles, having won in 2019, 2022 and 2023, could match Usain Bolt, who is currently the only man to four-peat at worlds over 200m. He is the first man since Bolt in 2015 to hold the 100m and 200m titles simultaneously. The Quincys and the 400m Quincy Hall: absent. The 400m Olympic champion from Paris — taking the first U.S. men’s gold in the distance since LaShawn Merritt in 2008 — had been progressing nicely in 2025. A textbook slow opener of 45.99 became a season’s best of 44.22 when he won at the Rome Diamond League in early June. Hall, though, scratched the Pre Classic, and whatever prevented him from racing there do not appear sufficiently healed. Advertisement He produced one of the performances of the Games last summer, out-kicking Great Britain’s Matthew Hudson-Smith very late to beat him on the line, finishing in a personal-best 43.40 that moved him up to fourth all-time. As the bronze medalist from Budapest, Hall does not have the wild card. That means a real shootout could occur for the third spot, should Khaleb McRae and Jacory Patterson qualify as one and two (as the form book reads). Vernon Norwood, Chris Bailey and Bryce Deadmon will all fancy their chances, especially with 2022 world champion Michael Norman still recovering from surgery last year — he has not raced at all in 2025. Enter 17-year-old Quincy Wilson. His 44.10 time earlier this month was the third occasion where he has bettered his own 400m world under-18 best , and he is the third-fastest this year of those attending trials. Wilson was the youngest male American track athlete last summer when he went as part of the relay squad, and became the youngest such gold medalist for the U.S. by leading out the men’s 4x400m relays in the heats. He did not race the final, but heat runners get medals too. It is a real chance for him to make the team individually. Muhammad and Brazier — 2019 world champions making comebacks At the 2019 world championships in Doha, Donovan Brazier won over 800m and Dalilah Muhammad took double gold from the 400m hurdles and 4x400m relay. Injuries have derailed Brazier’s career since. Aged 28, he has not made another global championships. Muhammad, now 35, won bronze in the 400m hurdles at the 2022 world championships (hosted at Hayward Field), but did not qualify for the 2023 worlds or 2024 Olympics. Both are having their best seasons in years and have the entry standards. Muhammad is running her fastest times since 2021, when she went to the Olympics. She is the second-fastest American woman this year in the 400m hurdles (52.58 seconds from Monaco in early July), behind only McLaughlin-Levrone. Advertisement Brazier has raced three 800m races this summer and gone faster each time, most recently clocking 1:43.08 at the London Diamond League . It makes him the third-fastest American man in 2025. Bryce Hoppel set a trials record last summer of 1:42.77 to take the national title, and with the current depth of U.S. men over two laps, sub-1:43 might be needed for a top-three spot. Two stacked 1,500m races It is the Olympic Champion (Cole Hocker) versus the Olympic Bronze medallist (Yared Nuguse) versus the former road mile World Champion (Hobbs Kessler) in the men’s 1,500m. That race also features Nathan Green, who won his second NCAA 1,500m Championship this summer, plus Liam Murphy, Ethan Strand and Gary Martin, who are all 3:33 guys and rank first, second and fourth on the all-time collegiate 1,500m lists. Fast or tactical, that race should bring fireworks. In the women’s race, eight athletes have the entry standard — though Elle St Pierre will not be racing, having given birth earlier this year. Last year’s trials saw Nikki Hiltz, Emily Mackay and St Pierre all go under 3:56 to make the team. Sinclaire Johnson has really stamped her mark this year and arrives as the second-fastest American over 1,500m — she took Hiltz’s North American record in the mile at the London Diamond League, clocking 4:16.32s. “Not going to lie, I was kind of happy I was the only American here (in London), so everyone else at home had to sit on the couch and watch,” Johnson said afterwards. “I’m feeling really confident going into trials.” The standout doublers Some athletes are entered across multiple events. Below are the top ones with a realistic proposition of qualifying in both. 100m/200m 1500/5,000m: Cole Hocker (2024 Olympic 1,500m Champion) 5,000m/10,000m: Triple jump/long jump: Jasmine Moore. In 2022, she was the first American woman to qualify for both events at a world championships, and last year became only the second athlete to win medals (two bronzes) in both horizontal jumps at an Olympics — a real unicorn. Shelby Houlihan’s return For the first time since 2020, when she won national titles over 1,500m and 3,000m indoors, Shelby Houlihan will participate at a U.S. championships. In June 2021, she was banned for four years after testing positive for nandrolone, an anabolic steroid. Houlihan has always maintained that the adverse finding came from a contaminated pork burrito — which is why she refused to accept a reduced three-year ban, with a guilty plea, that would have allowed her to return for last summer’s Olympics. Advertisement Her appeal to CAS in 2021 was rejected, which meant she missed that year’s Olympic trials. She first raced again in February, and, in March, she won silver over 3,000m at the World Indoor Championships in Nanjing, China (pictured below). A return to the Diamond League came in June, where she hit the 5,000m entry standard for Tokyo (14:45.29). Now 32, she still holds the 1,500m American record of 3:54.99, set in 2019. Four other American women have posted quicker 5,000m times than her during the qualifying window, so she will likely need to improve on her Rome performance if she is to qualify — Houlihan, at her best in 2020, was a 14:23 runner. All eyes on Anna Hall (Heptathlon, starts 11:00am Thursday, finishes 5:55pm Friday PT) In June, Anna Hall shocked herself and the world with a massive heptathlon PB of 7,032 in Gotzis, Austria. It made her only the fifth woman to break the 7,000 barrier and moved her up to third all-time. Injury issues had affected her in the build-up to last summer’s Olympics — dating back to breaking her foot at the 2021 trials. She had knee surgery in January 2024 but still won the national title comfortably and came fifth at the Paris Games. Hall is bidding to complete the set of world championship medals. She took world bronze three years ago in Eugene as a 21-year-old, then silver in Budapest the following year. There, Great Britain’s Katarina Johnson-Thompson beat her by the narrowest winning margin at a world championships (by 20 points). Qualification for Tokyo should be no problem; it is more about the seven performances and the total points. Based on her Gotzis result, Hall is the current gold-medal favorite for worlds.

            "As the countdown to the 2025 World Athletics Championships continues, elite U.S. track and field athletes gather in Eugene, Oregon, starting Thursday for the USA Track and Field Outdoor Championships. This pivotal event determines who among them will represent the United States at the upcoming global competition in Tokyo next September. With the championship's commencement marking less than seven weeks until the world's premier athletics meet, competitors face intense pressure to perform exceptionally well.\nIn line with international regulations, each country may enter up to three male and female athletes per discipline to the World Championships. However, there's also provision for 'wild card' entrants—an opportunity granted since 1997—to those currently holding individual world titles. Unlike previous years when Olympic gold medalists might receive such an advantage, this year's wildcard slots go exclusively to reigning world champions from Budapest in 2023.\nEight exceptional U.S. athletes hold these coveted wild card positions across various disciplines including sprinting, hurdling, throwing events, and jumping. Among them are Noah Lyles, Grant Holloway, and Sha’Carri Richardson—all vying for glory in their respective categories despite challenges ranging from injuries to fierce competition.\nFor most participants lacking a direct path to qualification due to wild card status, success hinges upon meeting either of the dual pathways set forth by World Athletics—the first being achieving a qualifying standard-performance within a designated timeframe followed by securing a podium finish at trials. Alternatively, athletes can rely on their standing in the world rankings—a composite score derived from their five best performances over twelve months—which offers a transparent measure of athletic prowess.\nThis system ensures fairness while acknowledging consistency and excellence beyond singular achievements. In women's high jump, for instance, although only eight contenders possess the necessary entry standard height of 1.97 meters, it's anticipated that Vashti Cunningham could claim her spot based solely on her rank rather than having met the standard herself.\nWith so many potential qualifiers competing under immense scrutiny, every second counts as athletes strive towards making history for themselves and their nation.",

        content:
            "Most of the more than 109,000 arrests carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first five months of President Trump's second term took place in border and Southern states, according to a CBS News analysis of government data. States in the southern U.S., as well as those along the border with Mexico, saw the highest levels of ICE arrests between the start of Mr. Trump's second term on Jan. 20 and June 27, the figures show. That continued a trend that predates the current administration, though ICE arrests have increased sharply across the country since last year. During the same time period in 2024, under the Biden administration, ICE made over 49,000 arrests, meaning that arrests by the agency have increased by 120% under the Trump administration. The statistics indicate that Texas saw nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests during that time period. About 11% of ICE arrests occurred in Florida and 7% in California, followed by 4% in Georgia and 3% in Arizona. ICE made the fewest arrests in Vermont, Alaska and Montana, about 100 total apprehensions combined. The locations of a small percentage of the arrests could not be discerned from the dataset, which was obtained by a group known as the Deportation Data Project through litigation. Overall, the individuals arrested by ICE between Jan. 20 and June 27 came from nearly 180 countries, but most were from Latin America or the Caribbean, according to the data. Mexico was the most common country of citizenship, with nearly 40,000 of those taken into ICE custody listed as Mexican citizens. Nationals of Guatemala and Honduras followed with around 15,000 and 12,000, respectively. Nearly 8,000 were citizens of Venezuela and over 5,000 of El Salvador. Immigration experts said the concentration of arrests in Southern and border states is not necessarily surprising and can largely be attributed to geography, demographics and the extent to which local law enforcement agencies cooperate with ICE. Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, explained that ICE tends to focus its resources in areas where local policies permit law enforcement interaction with federal immigration authorities, such as Texas and Florida. Other places, like California, may also see high levels of ICE arrests because they have large communities of immigrants, including those in the U.S. illegally, even though state and local policies limit collaboration with ICE. \"It's easier for ICE to be picking people up from state and local jails where there's cooperation,\" Bush-Joseph said. In cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies, \"ICE has to spend more resources picking up people for at-large arrests,\" she added. Bush-Joseph also noted the countries of origin for those arrested by ICE align with broader immigration trends. \"Generally, we're talking about countries that are geographically close\" to the U.S., she said. Latin American and Caribbean immigrants accounted for 84% of all unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2023, according to a recent report from the Migration Policy Institute. ICE is responsible for arresting, detaining and deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, as well as other noncitizens who lose their legal status, including because of criminal activity. The agency has been given a sweeping mandate by Mr. Trump, tasked with carrying out his campaign promise of overseeing the largest mass deportation effort in American history. Under the Trump administration, ICE has reversed Biden-era limits on arrests in the interior of the country and allowed deportation agents to arrest a broader group of individuals, including those who are in the U.S. illegally but who lack a criminal record . Todd Lyons , the acting ICE director, told CBS News recently that while his agents are still prioritizing the arrest of violent offenders who are in the U.S. illegally, anyone found to be in the country in violation of federal immigration law will be taken into custody. Halfway into Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, ICE recorded 150,000 deportations, putting the agency on track to carry out the most removals since the Obama administration, over a decade ago, CBS News reported. The tally is still far short of the 1 million annual deportations Trump officials have said they're targeting.

        ai_content:
            "During his initial tenure, President Donald Trump oversaw a substantial number of detentions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), with Texas alone accounting for almost one-quarter of all arrests within the first half-year of his presidency. A detailed examination conducted by CBS News using official records revealed that approximately 11% of these detentions transpired in Florida, another 7% in California, alongside smaller percentages in Georgia (4%) and Arizona (3%). In contrast, states like Vermont, Alaska, and Montana experienced minimal activity regarding ICE operations, collectively totaling just about 100 arrests.\nThe surge in detention activities reflects a broader national pattern observed throughout Trump's administration; however, it also represents a marked escalation compared to prior years. For instance, during the equivalent timeframe in 2024 under President Joe Biden's leadership, ICE executed upwards of 49,000 arrests—an increase exceeding 120% when juxtaposed against earlier periods.\nA closer look at the origins of those detained reveals a diverse international presence yet underscores a pronounced regional concentration. Nearly 180 different countries contributed to the pool of immigrants subject to deportation orders issued by ICE between January 20th and June 27th. Nevertheless, the majority originated from regions close to the United States' borders—in particular, Latin America and the Caribbean—with Mexicans comprising roughly 40% of the list of individuals held pending removal proceedings.\nThis geographic clustering aligns with insights provided by migration specialists who attribute the phenomenon primarily to factors including proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border, demographic trends favoring certain locales, and varying degrees of collaboration among state-level law enforcement bodies with federal immigration mandates.\nAs part of their ongoing efforts to shed light on these patterns, organizations such as the Deportation Data Project have acquired datasets via legal channels. These repositories offer invaluable perspectives on the scope and scale of immigration-related enforcement actions undertaken by ICE.",

        content:
            "One week into training camp, the only certainty with the Cleveland Browns’ running back situation is that the six participating sleep well at night. During each practice, running backs coach Duce Staley smiles diabolically at his players as he has them go through resistance band drills that include each player carrying 20-pound weighted footballs at the end of the band that connects two running backs. That’s sort of the appetizer for Staley’s sandbag drill, which puts 35-pound sandbags in each running back’s hands for three reps of short-area footwork, each covering about a minute. Advertisement Staley, 50, played his 10 NFL seasons before any of his current players could use him on their Madden video games. Back then, it was five miles — uphill both ways — for Staley to training camps that almost always included two practices per day, sometimes both in full pads. For Staley now, each day starts with a bit of a throwback tonesetter. “When those drills are done, you see the guys crying a bit,” Staley said. “Their arms are hurting.” Staley’s group has two returning veterans in Jerome Ford and Pierre Strong Jr. It does not have the full roster it was expected to have, as Quinshon Judkins, the second of Cleveland’s two second-round picks, remains unsigned and away from the team in the wake of his July 12 arrest on a domestic violence charge. The team has no timetable for Judkins’ eventual return, but the Browns’ quest to let the power run game drive the offense continues. Nobody’s saying much about Judkins specifically, but Ford said the players approach it as “there are more reps for everyone — just more work at this point.” So, a few months after Ford took a pay cut to essentially ensure his roster spot and the Browns drafted a second running back, Dylan Sampson, in the fourth round, a rotation that was supposed to have Judkins as a central figure and likely the eventual touches leader remains open. Ahmani Marshall, an undrafted rookie who’s listed at 225 pounds, is trying to prove he should get further chances and an opportunity to eventually stick. Strong, who’s mostly been a special teams player, was first in line early in camp. Ford has only been a full participant in two practices after dealing with a minor injury. Sampson was first up in team drills on Wednesday, but the Browns generally rotate their offensive skill players on every snap during camp practices. Advertisement So, we’ve seen Ford (210 pounds) and Sampson (200) with all three offensive units as the Browns cycle through quarterbacks and the last phase of their offensive installation. “Everybody shows up ready to work,” Sampson said. “No days off with Duce and no days off for any of us pushing each other. There’s an intentionality to everything. Every day matters. I think Coach Duce has set high standards, and that’s the kind of standard I want to hold myself to. “I think if we do things the right way right now, we’ll be ready for whatever roles we have when it’s time to go win football games.” Wednesday’s practice was the first in Kevin Stefanski’s six years as head coach that the Browns had a live tackling period. That’s part of Stefanski and all of his coaches continuing to try to set a physical tone — and part of finding out which of their runners are ready for life in the AFC North. Ford called the full tackling period “a really good thing I hope to see again,” and it came two days after Sampson took the loudest hit of training camp thus far from fellow rookie Carson Schwesinger on an inside run. “I think Dylan got (reminded) that he needs to get his damn pads down,” Staley said. It’s still early for everyone. Six practices in, the Browns have no final answers in their running back rotation. Early thoughts on the pass-catching group Stefanski said he rotates the offensive skill players on nearly every play for several reasons. Chief among them is an emphasis on communication, getting the right groups in and out of the huddle, and also keeping as many players as possible involved. Though the pass-catching groups have clear leaders in wide receiver Jerry Jeudy and tight end David Njoku, the rest of the rotations at those specific positions are as wide open as the running back group at this point. Advertisement Usually, the first players up in three-receiver sets are Jeudy, Cedric Tillman and Jamari Thrash. Diontae Johnson has mostly played with the second and third offensive units, but he’s an experienced slot receiver. Wednesday was the most active day for Kaden Davis, who’s on his sixth NFL stop after joining the Browns’ practice squad late last season. Davis caught a deep corner route from Dillon Gabriel early in practice and later made a nice catch on a crossing route from Joe Flacco. Veteran DeAndre Carter has mostly been a return specialist in recent years, but he’s taken a lot of wide receiver reps also. Luke Floriea and Gage Larvadain have been the most targeted of the four undrafted rookie receivers, but Kisean Johnson was with Flacco and the No. 1 offense in team drills Tuesday, when Jeudy was mostly given the day off. . @ShedeurSanders connects on the rollout with @JohnsonKisean 🎯 pic.twitter.com/c8ISkfQBEb — Cleveland Browns (@Browns) July 30, 2025 Diontae Johnson has no guaranteed money on his one-year deal but has the most career production of the group. After a quiet start to camp, he’s been more involved this week. The wide receiver group might eventually make at least one external addition, but thus far it’s had one deletion. Michael Woods II was waived-injured on Wednesday, effectively ending his season with the Browns. Assuming Woods clears waivers, he’ll revert to the team’s injured-reserve list. Woods was not a roster lock but was in the mix. Now that he’s out of the plans, players such as Davis and Carter move closer to roster spots, the rookies move up in the rotation, and the team’s personnel department probably revisits its list of bigger receivers who might either be available or become available in August. It might end up being Diontae Johnson versus Thrash for the primary slot receiver role — or even for a roster spot — but it’s too early to know for sure. Special teams will factor in. Davis and Floriea were first up as kickoff returners in one of Wednesday’s special teams drills. This week, we’ve seen rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. sprinkle in with the No. 1 offense more frequently than he did early in camp or in the spring. Regardless of which unit or quarterback with whom he’s shared the field, Fannin has been a frequent target . Advertisement Given that Fannin is still relatively new to the position and just turned 21 before the start of camp, it’s easy to say he’s ahead of schedule. Even if that’s not wholly accurate, it’s clear that the Browns aren’t focusing solely on the future for Fannin. Njoku and Fannin are roster locks, and early camp rotations say Blake Whiteheart and Brenden Bates are next. (Top photo of Dylan Sampson: Jason Miller / Getty Images)",

            "In the midst of Cleveland Browns' training camp, Coach Duce Staley's running backs endure grueling exercises designed to toughen them up for the upcoming season. Amidst these preparations, there looms a cloud of uncertainty over the team's running back depth chart, primarily because Quinshon Judkins, one of the team's key draft prospects, is absent due to legal issues stemming from a recent arrest related to domestic violence. As Judkins awaits resolution—without a set date for his potential return—the Browns continue to push forward with their offensive strategy centered around the ground game.\nStaley's regimen includes resistance band drills where players carry 20-pound weighted footballs attached to bands connecting pairs of runners. This serves as a precursor to the main event—a sandbag drill featuring 35-pound bags placed in each runner's hand for brief bursts of high-intensity footwork. These sessions often leave participants visibly exhausted, underscoring the physical demands of modern-day football.\nDespite the absence of Judkins, the Browns still boast seasoned talent like Jerome Ford and Pierre Strong Jr., alongside promising newcomers such as undrafted rookie Ahmani Marshall. Ford, having taken a significant salary reduction to secure his place on the team, finds himself competing against other talented rookies including Sampson, whom they selected in the fourth round of the draft.\nStrong Jr., typically known for his contributions on special teams, initially seized opportunities presented by Judkins' unavailability. However, injuries have kept Ford out of action since joining the team mid-season. Meanwhile, Marshall seeks to carve out his role within the squad, hoping to demonstrate his worthiness beyond initial impressions.\nAs the Browns navigate this challenging period, fans and analysts alike watch closely to determine how the team will adapt its strategies without Judkins' presence. Will Ford emerge as a leading force among the running backs? Can Marshall break through and establish himself as a reliable option? Only time—and continued hard work under Staley's guidance—will tell.",

            "The Cincinnati Reds bookended their 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday with a pair of trades, acquiring former Gold Glove third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the Pittsburgh Pirates before the game and right-handed starter Zack Littell from the Tampa Bay Rays after the game. For a team that was in search of an outfield bat and bullpen help, it might sound odd that the team added an infielder and a starter, but both moves had ripple effects that fill the outfield and bullpen. Hayes moves third baseman Noelvi Marte to the outfield, and Littell moves Wednesday’s Reds starter, Nick Martinez, to the bullpen in a swingman role. Advertisement “We looked at the relief market where we could add to the bullpen, and this was the best of both worlds where we got to add starting depth and add to the bullpen by putting Martinez there,” said Nick Krall, the Reds’ president of baseball operations. The Reds sent 21-year-old left-hander Adam Serwinowski and 28-year-old right-hander Brian Van Belle to the Rays in exchange for Littell. The Reds had acquired Van Belle from the Boston Red Sox last month. The Rays traded Serwinowski to the Dodgers. Los Angeles had asked for Serwinowski, who was 1-7 with a 4.84 ERA at High-A Dayton this year, in the Gavin Lux deal last offseason but was rebuffed. Krall said he broached the subject of Martinez moving to the bullpen with him before his start against the Dodgers on Wednesday and then again after Martinez allowed just two runs on four hits over six innings in the team’s victory over the Dodgers. “He’s one of the best teammates you could ever be around,” Krall said of Martinez. “He just wants to do whatever is best for the team.” A quality six innings from Nick Martinez! pic.twitter.com/lnOUK9ulhh — Cincinnati Reds (@Reds) July 31, 2025 It might sound like a cliche, but Martinez has shown he’s willing to back up those words with actions. Even though he’s the team’s highest-paid player after accepting a $21.05 million qualifying offer last offseason, Martinez has twice pitched out of the bullpen this season. A year ago, he started the season in the rotation, moved to the bullpen and then returned to the rotation for the last two months of the season. Martinez was 5-2 with a 1.86 ERA over 26 appearances and 53 1/3 innings last season out of the bullpen and 5-5 with a 3.84 ERA as a starter, but he was 5-2 with a 3.24 ERA over 11 starts after being moved back to the rotation. After Wednesday’s game against the Dodgers, he’s 9-9 with a 4.61 ERA. He has been perfect in his two relief appearances, spanning three innings. Advertisement The Reds recently found out that starter Carson Spiers will require elbow surgery and be lost for the year, so adding starting depth was important for a team that fell out of contention in 2023 in part because it didn’t have enough starting depth. In 2021, the Reds were in the playoff hunt until the last weekend, going into game No. 158 needing a win to stay alive. For that game, the team’s starter, Riley O’Brien, was making his big-league debut. With Littell, the Reds still have Martinez, who can go back and forth between the rotation and the bullpen, and then can add another reliever when the rosters expand in September, giving them more options. The Reds should welcome back Opening Day starter Hunter Greene sometime in August. Greene made his first Triple-A rehab appearance Tuesday and is scheduled to pitch again Sunday. When Greene returns, rookie Chase Burns will likely go to the bullpen, in part to help keep his innings down. Burns, the No. 2 pick in last year’s MLB Draft, has thrown 93 1/3 innings between the majors and minors this year after throwing 100 at Wake Forest last season. Burns started Monday against the Dodgers and took the loss but finished with 10 strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings, allowing three runs on six hits. Burns is scheduled to start Saturday’s game against the Atlanta Braves at Bristol Motor Speedway in his home state of Tennessee. “We’re going to work through his innings and see where they all stack up,” Krall said. “The goal is for him to end the season playing, not getting shut down.” Littell, 29, threw six shutout innings for the Rays against the New York Yankees on Wednesday, allowing just two hits with four walks and four strikeouts. Littell is 8-8 with a 3.58 ERA in 22 starts this season. He had his worst start since April on Friday at Great American Ball Park against Martinez and the Reds. Advertisement In the series opener, the Reds tagged him for five earned runs on 10 hits, including two home runs, one by TJ Friedl and the other from Tyler Stephenson, one of his new catchers with the Reds. Littell has allowed 26 home runs, the most in the majors. Though Great American Ball Park has a deserved reputation for allowing home runs, it might be better than the Rays’ temporary home, George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Fla. According to MLB Park Factors statistics, Steinbrenner Field has allowed 20 percent more home runs than the average field, and GABP sits at 11 percent. That said, only eight of the 26 home runs Littell has allowed this season have been at the team’s home park. Yankee Stadium, where he pitched Wednesday, allows 19 percent more homers than average. Krall said the team still has some money in the budget to add but noted it wasn’t a lot. “You’d always like to add more if you can,” Krall said. “But if this is our group, we’ve got a good group, and we’re excited about it.” (Photo of Nick Martinez throwing to first: Albert Cesare / The Enquirer / USA Today Network via Imagn Images)",

Despite being the team's most valuable asset financially since taking a $21.05 million qualifying offer last offseason, Martinez maintained his commitment to team success rather than personal accolades.\nThe Reds' proactive approach not only addressed immediate concerns regarding offensive power and pitching stability but also reflected a broader vision for sustained competitiveness through adaptable talent management.",

            "Fewer students will enroll in public schools in Central Florida this year, and districts face millions of dollars in budget shortfalls as a result.",
        content:
            "Central Florida school districts are preparing for a leaner financial year, driven by declining enrollment, when classes start next month. Fewer students will enroll in the region’s public schools, and districts face millions of dollars in state funding cutbacks as a result. They also fear cuts to federal grants, which are a significant source of public school funds. “It’s just this perfect storm,” said Angie Gallo, an Orange County School Board member and president of the Florida School Boards Association. Smaller budgets are prompting the districts to eliminate some teaching staff and other positions. Local school boards tentatively approved their budgets for the 2025-26 school year this week. The problems are statewide, with public school enrollment projected to drop across Florida by more than 70,000 students, and districts from South Florida to Tallahassee looking at cutting programs and staff and even closing campuses. Orange County Public Schools projects it will lose up to $27 million in state funding in the coming year because of a loss of about 3,100 students. In its tentative $5.8 billion budget approved Tuesday, the Orange County School Board is planning to spend about $1.4 billion, or 20%, less in the coming year than it did in the 2024-25 school year. The dollars given to districts by the state aren’t keeping up with inflation, said Chair Teresa Jacobs, during the meeting. Florida’s school voucher program is also harming public schools, she said, as families opt for state-funded private school scholarships rather than public schools. This coming year about $211 million that would have gone to OCPS will go instead to vouchers, up from $152 million last school year. Florida expanded its school voucher program in 2023, making all students, regardless of family income, eligible for scholarships, and voucher use has risen dramatically since then while public school enrollment has dipped. “If the state has that much money for education, the question is, why aren’t they putting it into public schools?” Jacobs said. To counter enrollment losses, OCPS has hired a consulting firm to try and recruit students back from private and charter schools. The largest reduction in this year’s budget is a $1.4 billion cut to OCPS’s capital projects, as the district makes a “very rare” move to pause some new school construction for the first time in decades. Because of the enrollment declines, OCPS didn’t re-hire about 430 full-time teachers this spring, according to district spokesperson Michael Ollendorff. However, most of those teachers should still end up with a teaching job in OCPS because of retirements and resignations, he added. Gallo said administrators have suggested asking voters to approve an additional property tax to help fund teacher pay amid the district’s financial problems, but the talks are preliminary and the soonest a tax hike could be up for a vote would be in 2026. OCPS already levies a voter-approved special property tax, as well as a voter-approved half-penny sales tax, which has been in place since 2002 and was approved again in 2024. In Seminole County, Superintendent Serita Beamon said the district saw a decrease of about 1,000 students for the 2024-25 school year, equating to a loss of more than $13 million in state funding, and expects to lose about 1,500 more students next year. Coupled with decreases in federal funding, that will likely mean an even bigger monetary loss for the upcoming year, Beamon said. As a result, more than 90 district school positions — including teachers and aides — were eliminated. The district tried to shrink its teaching force through retirement, she said, but some teachers have been told their contracts will not be renewed for the coming school year starting on August 11. “It’s a challenge to deal with the uncertainty of the decline,” Beamon said at the county’s state of the school address Monday. To up its student enrollment numbers, Seminole schools began opening its doors to students from other counties. Lake also expects to cut staff due to enrollment losses. The district projects to lose about 1,500 students and about $8 million in state funding next year , said district spokesperson Sherri Owens. Chad Farnsworth, the district’s assistant superintendent for human resources and employee relations, said more than 60 positions could be on the chopping block, including a drop-out prevention teacher, a college and career readiness administrator and five maintenance staff. Farnsworth told the school board at a June budget meeting that cutting those positions would save about $2.7 million. “We’ve got to keep a conservative mindset when it comes to dollars moving forward,” he said. The School District of Osceola County, the only local school district to expect more students next year, projects an increase of more than 2,600, according to state data.",

            "In Central Florida, educational institutions are bracing for what officials describe as a 'perfect storm' of fiscal challenges stemming from dwindling student populations. As class commencements loom on the horizon, these districts confront not only fewer enrollees but also considerable slashes in state funding allocations. The situation reflects a broader trend across Florida, where projections indicate a decline exceeding 70,000 pupils within the state's public schooling system.\nThe ramifications extend beyond mere headcounts; districts grapple with multimillion-dollar deficits precipitated by reduced enrolments coupled with anticipated curtailments in federal grant support—an essential lifeline for many schools. Angie Gallo, President of the Florida School Boards Association, encapsulates the predicament succinctly: 'It's just this perfect storm.' Faced with shrinking coffers, local school boards have cautiously ratified their budgets for the upcoming academic cycle amidst widespread apprehension regarding programme eliminations, staffing redundancies, and even the shuttering of entire campuses.\nOrange County Public Schools exemplifies the crisis, forecasting a staggering $27 million deficit attributable to approximately 3,100 fewer students—a stark contrast to previous years' figures. The county's provisional budget earmarks roughly $1.4 billion—or 20% less—in comparison to the preceding year's allocation. Such austerity measures underscore concerns voiced by Chair Teresa Jacobs concerning stagnant state contributions failing to keep pace with inflationary pressures.\nCompounding these woes is the burgeoning impact of Florida's expansive school voucher initiative. With eligibility now extended universally irrespective of familial wealth, scholarship uptake has surged precipitously alongside plummeting public school attendance rates. Consequently, Orange County anticipates redirecting upwards of $211 million towards vouchers—the bulk of which previously bolstered its own institution—up from $152 million in prior cycles.\nTo mitigate enrolment attrition, OCPS has enlisted consultancy expertise aimed at enticing former private and charter school attendees back into the fold. However, the most pronounced budgetary contraction looms large: a formidable $1.4 billion deduction targeting OCPS's capital project fund—a move likely emblematic of wider systemic retrenchments poised to reshape Florida's educational landscape.",

            "Mayor Brandon Johnson said he's open to reviving the job-killing head tax and a thinly disguised bid to impose a city corporate income tax. These are terrible ideas.",
        content:
            "We wrote a few days ago that we’d wait to see what Mayor Brandon Johnson had in mind when he said he would pursue “progressive revenue” options rather than a property tax hike to help plug Chicago’s $1 billion-plus deficit for next year before passing judgment. It didn’t take long for Johnson to put some meat on the bones. In outlining his ideas for reporters on Tuesday, the mayor opted not to wait for his mayorally appointed working group striving to meet an Aug. 31 deadline to report on initial ideas for making city government more efficient, as well as considering options to raise revenue. Among the possibilities the mayor said “have to be on the table”: reviving the corporate head tax; imposing a thinly disguised corporate income tax; and “asking” universities, endowments and other large-scale nonprofits to pay substantial sums in lieu of the property taxes from which they are shielded. Before we get to the substance of these extraordinarily counterproductive ideas, let’s address Johnson’s foolishness in front-running the report his working group of business figures, labor leaders, nonprofit representatives and others are slated to produce in a month. The whole idea of creating that ad hoc group back in the spring was to try to forge some kind of rough consensus on how to dig the city out from its structurally imbalanced budgets year after year. The impetus was to avoid the sort of top-down budget dictates that got Johnson into so much political trouble when he broke his campaign promise not to raise property taxes and proposed a $300 million increase — which aldermen then unanimously rejected. So much for that approach. By saying he’s on board with several highly controversial tax proposals before his group even weighs in, Johnson now has confirmed, at least in the minds of his numerous skeptics, that the exercise always was little more than window dressing for an administration bent on doing what it has wanted to do from the start — soak the “rich” in order to bankroll an ever-growing government apparatus. We sought reactions to the mayor’s remarks from several participants on that working group and were told they’re operating under nondisclosure agreements. Of course such pacts don’t apply to the mayor himself, who’s free to undermine this effort before it produces anything while forcing those who’ve risked their reputations on behalf of the city to keep their mouths shut. We wouldn’t want to be part of a group that wasn’t given the freedom to reach its own conclusions before the boss had laid out his agenda. Of the various “progressive” tax ideas available to Johnson and the dwindling number of aldermen who support him, the one with the fewest roadblocks is the corporate head tax, the per-job levy that Mayor Rahm Emanuel rightly killed in 2014. The obvious reason for ending the head tax back then is just as valid today: Taxing businesses based on the number of people they employ is a disincentive to hire people. As a matter of public policy, the city ought to be in the business of encouraging the private sector to employ more people, not giving businesses more reasons to reduce their head count. In 2025, the issue is starker than it was more than a decade ago. With the rise in artificial intelligence, companies nationwide already are laying off workers who are performing functions corporate leaders believe AI can do instead. If Johnson truly wants to jump-start AI-induced white-collar employment losses in Chicago, there are few more effective ways than bringing back the head tax. Will the City Council have any appetite to send such a terrible message to job creators at a time when Chicago’s economy is flatlined (the mayor’s Donald Trump-like claims that growth is surging here notwithstanding)? We doubt it. That leaves a more pernicious proposal pushed by the nonprofit Institute for the Public Good, which has a representative on the mayor’s working group. Based on a tax Seattle approved several years ago, that group has floated an “excise tax” on payrolls for those making $200,000 or more (including stock options and various forms of noncash compensation) — meant to substitute for a corporate income tax that Chicago doesn’t have the legal authority to impose. The organization estimates a 5% payroll tax along those lines would generate $1.5 billion annually. Ald. Maria Hadden, 49th, who co-chairs the City Council’s Progressive Caucus, told Crain’s she’d consider such an approach if nonprofits like hospitals and universities were exempted. That still would generate more than $1.1 billion, she said. That proposal isn’t likely to trip up on the AI issue outlined above, but also could be easily evaded by companies moving their operations outside the city and basing their more highly compensated employees in, say, Evanston, Oak Park or any other suburb. Especially given the ease of remote work these days, such moves wouldn’t be difficult. The city already is seeing substantial reductions in its white-collar workforce, statistics show, a trend that surely exacerbates municipal revenue challenges and too much of the time keeps downtown Chicago something close to a dead zone. Any kind of excise payroll tax is a truly terrible idea. Johnson told reporters repeatedly that business people with whom he’s interacted tell him they mainly care about violent crime and that the cost of doing business doesn’t come up. “Not that I know a bunch of millionaires,” he said. “But you know what they talk about when they engage with me? They talk about community safety. They don’t talk about taxes.” This is a mayor with no experience in the private sector, and it shows over and over again. To suggest businesses (or the “ultra-rich,” as the mayor likes to call the wealthier among us) care not a whit about a key cost input like taxes is laughable. If aldermen out of desperation decide to try this gambit, the city will be sued and the matter will be tied up in the courts. At the very least, the 2026 budget hole won’t be plugged this way. True to form, the mayor expounds at length on various and sundry ways to part people and businesses from their money and does little but nod briefly and generally to reducing the cost of government. The budget process hasn’t even started, and Johnson already has ruled out any concessions from unionized city workers like layoffs or furloughs to balance next year’s books. By once again focusing only on economically destructive taxes that we’re guessing won’t get far with skittish aldermen afraid to tie their political futures to a deeply unpopular mayor, Johnson risks a reprise of last year’s eleventh-hour budget crisis.

            "In a recent editorial, concerns have been raised about Mayor Brandon Johnson's proposal to explore various 'progressive' taxation methods to alleviate Chicago's looming $1 billion deficit expected for the upcoming year. Johnson revealed his willingness to revisit measures previously deemed detrimental, including the reinstatement of the corporate head tax—a levy once criticized—and the introduction of a covert corporate income tax scheme.\nThe mayor's announcement came swiftly following his pledge to seek alternative funding strategies beyond increasing property taxes. On Tuesday, Johnson outlined potential solutions during discussions with journalists, bypassing the anticipated findings of his advisory committee composed of local business leaders, labor union members, nonprofit executives, and other stakeholders convened last spring.\nThis committee was established to develop consensual approaches to rectify the city's chronic financial imbalance through enhanced operational efficiencies and innovative revenue streams. However, Johnson's premature endorsement of contentious tax initiatives casts doubt on the genuine collaborative intent behind forming the group—an effort initially designed to prevent unilateral decisions reminiscent of past controversies involving Johnson's unfulfilled promises against property tax hikes.\nJohnson's actions suggest a predetermined agenda focused on redistributing wealth among affluent entities while expanding governmental reach. Despite requests for input from those involved in the working group, responses remain confidential due to non-disclosure agreements. Critics argue that Johnson's preemptive stance undermines the purpose of collective deliberation and signals a departure from transparent governance.",

            "When Black women rapidly disappear from the workforce, we are faced with more than a concerning statistic; their loss is a warning for where the country is headed. Black women are the only population to experience a rise in unemployment in the last three months with rates spiking above 6% , twice the rate for white workers. Additionally, this does not capture the more than 500,000 that have yet to return to the labor force since the pandemic, making the real unemployment rate above 10%. The cause of this recent rise is not a mystery. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have laid waste to the federal workforce, and the Department of Government Efficiency’s reckless job cuts have wiped out thousands of stable and middle-class jobs. True to these officials’ disdain for any mention of diversity, the people most directly affected by these job cuts are Black women, who, for decades, have depended on federal roles to support families and build economic security. Federal employment is one of the few job sectors where Black women have had meaningful access to upward mobility, making up over 12% of the federal workforce — double their share of the labor force overall. The loss of their presence also means the loss of irreplaceable expertise, knowledge and skills that have benefited the entire American public. Black women are the foundation and the heart of public service — processing veterans’ benefits at the Department of Veterans Affairs so those who served this nation aren’t left behind, guiding students through applying for financial aid from the Department of Education, protecting air and water at the Environmental Protection Agency, and coordinating disaster response at the Federal Emergency Management Agency when communities are in crisis. We hold the government together at every level, shaping policy and driving change, often without any recognition. Economists maintain that Black Americans — particularly Black women — are often an indicator of economic shifts . When Black women start to lose jobs, they signal a crack in the entire economy. The crisis we face is not limited to one community; we are barreling toward an economic tipping point fueled by the chaos of Trump’s agenda. Trump won on a promise to lower costs but has used his first six months in office to make life more expensive for everyday families and businesses. His disastrous tariffs have hit Americans hard, and now the Republican budget is slashing essential services, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid, that protected our most vulnerable. The impacts will be felt not just by Black women and their families. Already, consequences are reverberating through rural and urban communities as Trump’s Cabinet dismantles decades of progress, damages the futures of our children and hurts America’s economy, leaving a trail of destruction for future generations to clean up. Illinois is choosing a different path — one that expands opportunity for all working-class families, including Black women. The JB Pritzker-Juliana Stratton administration, alongside partners and advocates across the state, has expanded investments and opened doors where others have slammed them shut. Our work has ranged from increasing investment in Black-owned small businesses, to strengthening the Equal Pay Act to make sure Black Illinoisans are paid fair wages, and ensuring working people can take up to 40 hours of paid time off to care for themselves and their families. We are doing everything in our power to make Illinois the best state in the nation to live, work and raise a family without exception. As Black women, we know what it means to work within, and against, systems that were never built for someone who looks like us. We know how it feels to do everything right and still be forced to carry the weight of a system that turns its back on us. We want every Black woman in Illinois to hear this; Trump may be trying to erase the gains we’ve made, but he can’t erase us. Black women are the backbone of the economy — and when we lose ground, the whole nation feels the impact. And this fight is not for us alone. Black women’s increasing struggles are an urgent clarion call to every person to stand up and speak out, for all our sakes. Juliana Stratton is the lieutenant governor of Illinois.

            "The United States faces a troubling trend as Black women confront rising unemployment levels exceeding 6%, starkly contrasting with less than half that figure experienced by white counterparts. This surge represents a significant portion of the nation's workforce grappling with job losses attributed primarily to sweeping budgetary decisions made under former President Donald Trump's tenure. The ramifications extend far beyond mere numbers, signaling potential perilous turns within America's broader economic landscape.\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which already saw millions sidelined from active participation in the labor market, additional cutbacks further exacerbate the situation. An estimated 500,000 individuals remain absent from work rolls, pushing true unemployment estimates past the critical threshold of 10%.\nAt the core of this issue lies a series of calculated reductions implemented by the Trump administration aimed at streamlining governmental operations—a move that has inadvertently targeted key demographics reliant upon federal employment opportunities. Black women, historically marginalized groups facing systemic barriers to equal opportunity, find themselves bearing the brunt of such policies.\nFederal jobs once offered a rare avenue towards socioeconomic stability and progress for many Black women—an opportunity now slipping away. Representing approximately 12% of the federal workforce, their contributions span vital functions including veteran assistance via the Department of Veterans Affairs, student guidance through financial aid programs managed by the Department of Education, environmental protection efforts coordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency, and crucial coordination during disasters led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nThese roles do not merely represent individual careers; they embody collective societal gains achieved through years of dedicated public service. As economists suggest, fluctuations in Black women's employment status serve as harbingers for wider economic trends. Thus, the current trajectory portends a looming economic precipice driven by what some critics describe as 'Trump's chaotic agenda.'\nAs America stands at this crossroads, it's imperative to recognize the profound implications of losing such integral members of its workforce—not just for them personally but for society at large.",

            "Mayor Brandon Johnson and his administration are touting reductions in homicides and other violent crime in Chicago as proof that his safety plan is working. However, in some neighborhoods, residents do not believe that crime is down. Two-thirds of Chicago residents are concerned about public safety in the area where they live, a 2024 Harris Poll found . The data in distressed neighborhoods is bucking the midyear national trend of reductions in violent crime across the country. Austin, the neighborhood Johnson calls home, leads the city with 29 homicides so far this year. In 2024, Austin finished the year with 47 homicides. In too many neighborhoods, people feel unsafe. The following neighborhoods lead the city in homicides and shooting victims: Austin, Englewood, Garfield Park, South Shore, North Lawndale and Auburn Gresham. These neighborhoods are predominantely African American. I am appalled that more than 75% of the victims of gun violence are young Black men and boys. African Americans account for 28% of the city’s population. The Black community does not feel a 30% drop in homicides and nonfatal shootings — because their neighborhoods remain places with high violence. Aretha Franklin, the singer, had it right: You have to give the people “something they can feel.” The city of Chicago data notes that 18% of the fatal and nonfatal victims of gun violence are Latino and 2.4% are white. Thirty-nine percent of the Chicago population is white. Why is there so much violence in Black communities and very little in predominately white areas? In white communities, there is economic stability. A dollar circulates six hours in an African American community, compared with 17 days in a white community, 19 days in a Jewish community and 28 days in an Asian community. Building wealth in the Black community will lead to economic stability and likely lower crime rates. The mayor’s policies supporting red light and speed cameras, parking tickets and high taxes could be causing economic hardship and anger. Economic instability coupled with high poverty, unemployment and poor-performing schools are a recipe for disaster. How can Johnson celebrate reductions in violence when his community is in crisis? Over 50% of the people being shot in Chicago are young, from children to adults who up to 29 years old. Our young people represent the future. Some of the teen gatherings downtown have led to violence and property damage. I believe the City Council rightly passed an ordinance to address this issue. Unfortunately, the mayor vetoed the legislation . Johnson should get out of the way and allow Chicago police Superintendent Larry Snelling to do his job. The superintendent is respected by his peers and the community. I believe if he were allowed to do his job without political interference, more cases would be solved and communities made safer. I understand what it is like to be a victim of violent crime. I lost my 20-year-old son, Omar, to gun violence. It is a pain that stays with surviving family members. That pain is made worse when the perpetrators are not brought to justice. While crime numbers are trending down, if people are victimized and no one is held accountable, that amplifies gun violence in high-crime areas and sends a signal to criminals that community safety is not a priority. Related Articles Willie Wilson: Is Illinois’ state procurement being used effectively to stabilize communities of color? Willie Wilson: Chicagoans cannot wait 50 years for clean water Willie Wilson: The unfinished business of Juneteenth Block Club Chicago and The Trace recently reported that the city’s homicide clearance rate is still declining , even with fewer homicides to solve. In 2024, police made arrests in 16% of fatal shootings within a year of the incident, down from 23% in 2022. Eighty percent of Chicago’s fatal shooting victims were Black, and their cases had a significantly lower clearance rate. Thus, families do not have closure, and no one has been held accountable for shooting their loved one. The following are suggestions to curb violence in African American neighborhoods: Johnson, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Gov. JB Pritzker should use procurement opportunities to stabilize the South and West sides. Johnson, Preckwinkle and Pritzker should focus resources to address substance abuse, health and food deserts on the South and West sides. Elected leaders should give parents the support they need to raise their children in safe neighborhoods with quality schools. Pritzker, Johnson and Preckwinkle should announce a public works program around removing lead pipes from homes and employ people from the South and West sides. Lead poisoning through drinking water or paint could cause significant harm to a child’s brain development. Johnson should give Snelling the authority to call a snap curfew to address teen takeovers. Elected leaders should increase funding for victim and witness protection programs. Residents living on the South and West sides should not be living in fear. They deserve full-service grocery stores, banks and manufacturing facilities with well-paying jobs. The highest concentration of people returning from prisons across Illinois reside on the West and South sides. Elected leaders must provide investments in job training, vocational education and other wraparound services for individuals returning from prisons. The data is not always the best predictor of safe neighborhoods. The people living in those communities know when they are safe — they can feel it.

            "In stark contrast to Mayor Brandon Johnson's assertions of declining violent crime within Chicago, a substantial portion of its residents continue to express deep-seated fears for their personal safety. According to a 2024 Harris Poll, approximately two-thirds of Chicagoans harbor apprehensions concerning public safety in their immediate surroundings. This sentiment persists even though Johnson's administration points to overall reductions in such crimes as evidence of successful policy implementation.\nThe dissonance between official statistics and local perceptions becomes especially pronounced in certain neighborhoods characterized by distress and elevated levels of violence. Notably, Austin stands out with 29 homicides reported thus far in the current year alone—a figure that surpasses the city's annual total from previous years. Other neighborhoods including Englewood, Garfield Park, South Shore, North Lawndale, and Auburn Gresham also report disproportionately high numbers of homicides and shooting incidents, reflecting broader trends observed nationwide.\nAlarmingly, these affected areas are overwhelmingly populated by African Americans—who constitute only 28% of Chicago's demographic makeup yet represent over three-quarters of those victimized by gun violence. Such disparities raise critical questions about why similar patterns of violence seem less prevalent in predominantly white districts, often attributed to greater economic stability and longer circulation times for currency within these communities.\nEconomic factors play a pivotal role; money moves significantly faster through affluent neighborhoods compared to economically disadvantaged ones. This rapid turnover suggests higher spending power and investment potential, contributing to stronger local economies capable of sustaining businesses and creating jobs. Conversely, systemic issues such as poverty, unemployment, subpar educational institutions, and punitive fiscal measures—including red light and speed cameras, hefty parking fines, and increased taxation—may exacerbate financial strain and foster resentment amongst marginalized populations.\nAs Mayor Johnson celebrates purported declines in urban violence, he faces criticism for seemingly overlooking the acute crises afflicting his own constituency. With over half of Chicago's shooting victims identified as youth under 25, the urgency for comprehensive solutions addressing root causes rather than merely symptomatic relief grows ever clearer.",

            "For 15 years, the annual poll has been a lightning rod for criticism and debate, telling us so much and so little. That's part of the point.",
        content:
            'Tyreek Hill sat down again with the NFL Films crew under the impression he’d be asked about a few of his Miami Dolphins teammates. Instead, running back Raheem Mostert crashed the scene with the 2024 edition of the “NFL Top 100” trophy, igniting one of the most memorable, and controversial, moments of the ranking show’s existence. Advertisement “I’ve been wanting this s— for so long!” Hill yelled, after lifting the 195-pound Mostert in celebration . “What’d I say in my rookie year, huh?” To be precise, not only did Hill predict, following his 2016 debut with the Kansas City Chiefs, that he’d be the best player in the NFL, but also he threatened to dethrone perhaps the greatest quarterback of all time. “I belong No. 1 over Tom Brady,” Hill said then. “Tom Brady, I’m calling you out.” . @cheetah really spoke it into existence 1️⃣🔮 #NFLTop100 pic.twitter.com/4hUX9F6Bff — NFL (@NFL) August 3, 2024 Seven years later, Hill was indeed No. 1. Fans met the announcement with skepticism. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who had been crowned No. 1 in two of the previous three rankings, finished fourth. Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, the reigning MVP, finished second. In a FanDuel poll on X, 85 percent of more than 3,500 respondents disagreed with Hill’s top status . Many criticized the selection, saying someone else was more deserving or citing Hill’s history of legal issues . This is precisely the “NFL Top 100.” Heated debates. Emotional reactions. Lightning-rod reveals. Fans and players have a complex relationship with the league’s annual player-driven poll, a list that tells us so much, but also so little. In 2010, NFL Network produced a show that ranked the 100 best players in league history . Given the show’s success, the network wanted to repurpose the concept into an annual event. Behold, the yearly “NFL Top 100” was born, debuting moments after the 2011 NFL Draft concluded. The concept was, and still is, simple: Rank the top 100 players of each NFL season, as voted on by their peers. No position requirements or team delegations. Players could even vote for themselves, and ballots could be anonymous. Why 100? It was a numbers game. A 10-episode series, with 10 players per show, to bridge the gap during the NFL’s slowest time of the year “sounded pretty great,” supervising producer Adam Ryan said. Advertisement This year, that bridge is even longer, as the show moved to X . Since June 30, two players have been revealed each weekday on the social media platform, leading to the top 10 unveiling on NFL Network on Sept. 1. From 2019 to 2024, “Top 100” programming never lasted longer than two weeks. This year’s reveal spans 10 weeks. “We had high hopes it would do well (on X), and it’s exceeding our expectations,” said Ryan, who has co-led the “Top 100” show since its beginning. “It cuts out the middleman because, look, it’s going to social media for debate anyway. Why not just get there quicker?” Since its inception, the “Top 100” process has remained fairly consistent. Players vote for their top 20 peers: No. 1 receives 20 points, and the points decrease in value until No. 20, who receives one point. Around 350-400 players receive votes each year, Ryan said, and the players at the No. 100 cutoff are usually separated by only a point or two. The poll’s biggest overhaul came in 2015. Instead of balloting players primarily at the Pro Bowl, the group began traveling to all 32 facilities. This increased participation among the league’s 1,700 active players from about 300 per year to between 900 and 1,100 today, Ryan said. NFL Films senior talent producer Erin O’Toole and others hand out ballots in locker rooms and cafeterias. The process starts after Thanksgiving, when the top players of a season begin to take shape, and most ballots are submitted well before the Super Bowl. O’Toole has seen it all in 10 years around the NFL block. “I have been in some legitimate locker room fights amongst teammates,” she said, recalling a feisty scene in 2015 with former Pittsburgh Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell leading the debate. The most heated locker room? The Minnesota Vikings, O’Toole said. Advertisement The most credible voters? Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby (“He really sits there and is very intentional with who he’s going to vote for”) or Denver Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II (“He’s so humble, he won’t put himself on his own ballot, and he was just Defensive Player of the Year ”). The funniest moment? One year, a rookie turned in a ballot including Cleveland Browns left tackle Joe Thomas ... years after his career ended. “I had to break it to him that Joe Thomas had been retired for like five years and was in the (Pro Football) Hall of Fame,” O’Toole said. “Sometimes they’re so locked in on their position and what they’re doing.” There are always surprises and controversy. Fullback Vonta Leach ranked ahead of Tony Romo in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2012, when Manning was recovering from neck surgery and had just signed with the Denver Broncos. The 2012 list also included a second fullback (John Kuhn) and Tim Tebow, whom the Broncos had traded to the New York Jets after signing Manning. Some of the biggest eyebrow-raisers, especially at quarterback, become time capsules, depicting a flash in the pan or an outlier season. Joe Flacco was 19th in 2013 after a historic playoff run and Super Bowl title. Derek Carr reached 11 in 2017 after finishing third in MVP voting. Nick Foles (70th in 2014), Blake Bortles (56th in 2016), Case Keenum (51st in 2018) and Mac Jones (85th in 2022) each made cameos. Ryan said he was “slightly surprised” with who ended up No. 1 this year, and that “you can make a strong case for everyone in the top five being No. 1.” Not even halfway through the reveals, the debates have started: Bo Nix and Sam Darnold over Dak Prescott? Cooper DeJean over Jalen Ramsey? There’s always something for fans to argue about. “The whole point of the list is to obviously celebrate the great players in the league, but also, any time you have a ranking, it’s going to be a huge debate,” O’Toole said. “And for us, debate is really good for the show because it brings attention. We want people to agree and disagree.” That debate comes naturally. Ed Hirt, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at Indiana University, has studied identity through the lens of sports fandom and allegiance. His research has linked positive self-esteem in sports fans to the success of that fan’s team, and vice versa. Advertisement Rankings are addictive because of how strongly fans identify themselves with their favorite teams and players, Hirt said. “A lot of our pride in ourselves is wrapped up in how our team does, but also in terms of us being knowledgeable fans,” Hirt said. “While we think it’s kind of silly that we feel like we affect the outcome of the game, we still feel like we know a lot about our team, and we’re very invested in that. We play GM.” But fans aren’t the only ones who drive conversation. Players haven’t been shy about their gripes with the rankings, either. In 2021, D.J. Humphries called the list “made up” because he thought his then-Arizona Cardinals teammate DeAndre Hopkins should have been higher than No. 8. In 2022, former Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams left tackle Andrew Whitworth, who appeared in the “Top 100” three times in his career, called the list a “joke” and “content filler.” They are far from the only detractors . Ryan and O’Toole both said they are open to criticism, and feedback was one of the reasons they extended their balloting outreach in 2015. “You’ll get the occasional player who criticizes that some people don’t take this seriously, and that’s true — some don’t,” Ryan said. “But when you have 900-plus ballots, it minimizes that.” Still, ratings from peers come with inherent biases. Factors outside of game play — like a player’s team, level of media coverage or personal relationships — can impact voters’ perception. The NFL is not alone in that. In this season’s WNBA All-Star voting , Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark ranked ninth among guards in player voting but third in media voting and first overall in fan voting. Although injuries have caused Clark to miss time this year, the voting discrepancy was hard to ignore. “What does that rating reflect? Is it jealousy that people are pissed off because she gets so much more attention?” Hirt said. “There are all these speculations about where those rankings are coming from, and all those things could be true. Advertisement “It’s easy to criticize. The harder thing is to come up with what would be better.” Ultimately, ranking the “best” players comes down to what each voter values. Players from the AFC West vote differently than their NFC West peers, Ryan said. And over time, it’s become clear that players are more likely to vote for someone they have played with or against. “Sometimes there are head-scratchers on the list,” Ryan said. “Then I interview a player about them, and they have this personal story about how dominant he was on this day, and it showed up in the film room, and it showed up on game day. Maybe the general public doesn’t know about it, and maybe other teams don’t know about it, but this player sure does.” The lack of position requirements has also opened the door for some voters to advocate for others they think most deserve the recognition. “Offensive linemen love to make sure there’s offensive line representation on the list,” O’Toole said. “Which I love, because I think they’re the unsung heroes of the NFL.” Even so, offensive linemen remain underrepresented, garnering just 125 selections in 14 editions of the ranking (8.9 per year), compared to 141 for running backs alone (10.1 per year). Only five times has an offensive lineman cracked the top 20, comfortably the fewest of any position except fullbacks and specialists. Running backs have done so 37 times. The best guard of his generation, seven-time All-Pro Zack Martin, never ranked higher than 53rd. Six-time All-Pro center Jason Kelce cracked the top 70 just once (37th in 2023). !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("[id=\'datawrapper-chart-tawJo\']");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}(); How does the “Top 100” compare to how teams value players? Fifteen offensive tackles rank among the NFL\'s 100 largest salaries (by annual average per Over the Cap, as of July 30), but only 5.4 per year have been ranked in the player poll since 2020. The other most underrepresented positions included defensive tackles and guards. Advertisement Linebacker representation is skewed in the opposite direction. Six linebackers currently have salaries in the top 100, but an average of 14.2 have appeared in the “Top 100” since 2020. It’s worth noting, though, that the “Top 100” ranking does not distinguish between edge-rushing outside linebackers and off-ball linebackers. Unsurprisingly, quarterbacks are most likely to wear the crown, ranking No. 1 in 10 of the poll’s 14 years, pending 2025’s results. Big-name QBs are a staple of the “Top 100,” with Brady ranking No. 1 a record four times and Aaron Rodgers appearing on the list in every year of its existence (he ranked 92nd last year despite playing only four snaps in the 2023 season, but has not appeared on this year\'s list so far). "You usually think it\'s going to be a quarterback every year, and more often than not, (it is), especially because it started in the Tom Brady dominant era," Ryan said. Trends have also changed over time. Running backs in the “Top 100” have steadily declined — from a peak of 15 (more than quarterbacks or receivers) in 2012 to five in 2024 — while the number of receivers has increased. That’s consistent with shifts in the contract market, where receiver deals have skyrocketed since 2022. Hill was the first wide receiver to rank No. 1 in the “Top 100.” !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("[id=\'datawrapper-chart-Agt6h\']");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}(); It’s all a test in social comparison theory, which Hirt explains as the tendency to judge ourselves based on how we compare to our peers. Even outside of pure rankings, social comparison is unavoidable in discussions around contract negotiations and trades. Of course, some players feel slighted by the “Top 100,” but that’s not necessarily bound to hinder their performance or attitude. “We tend to see it as negative, but it\'s a motivator, too,” Hirt said. “The question is, do you want to let it consume you?” Most players\' opinions of the “Top 100” fall somewhere between admirable and apathetic. But as the years pass, the list’s legacy has grown, especially for younger players who grew up watching the show. Lamar Jackson was proof when he went from unranked in 2019 to No. 1 in 2020. Advertisement “I used to always watch the ‘Top 100’ on YouTube or NFL Network, not thinking I’d actually be the No. 1 player,” said Jackson, who was 14 when the show debuted, in his interview . “I’m really speechless right now.” Moving most of this year’s “Top 100” programming to X was a step in the direction many behind the scenes saw coming. As for what’s next, O’Toole said she wants to continue leaning into fan interaction, perhaps with reaction shows, a concept they tested in the early days of the list. Virtual balloting is a point of conversation each year, too. The network used online balloting during the pandemic in 2020, but participation dipped. For now, producers see advantages with in-person balloting and how it separates “Top 100” voting from that of the Pro Bowl, Ryan said. “Hopefully, we continue to refine our process,” Ryan said. “Every time a player criticizes the list, we listen. We\'re not going to get to 1,700 out of 1,700 players happy, but that doesn\'t mean we can\'t try.” Fun facts • Offense has always outweighed defense. Defenders have accounted for 44.9 spots on average and never more than 49. Skill position players alone (including quarterbacks) outnumber defensive players on average with 46.0. • Jackson is the only player to jump from unranked to No. 1 in one year. He is also the youngest player to rank No. 1 (23 in 2020). • In 2016, NFL Films began releasing the "just missed" players who ranked No. 101 to 110. Nine-time Pro Bowl center Maurkice Pouncey has been relegated to the "best of the rest" more often than anyone else, with appearances in 2017 (No. 107), 2018 (108) and 2020 (102). Pouncey twice cracked the “Top 100,” at 49 in 2014 and 83 in 2015. • The most volatile player among his peers? That would be tight end Jimmy Graham, who was unranked in 2011, 14th in 2012, unranked in 2013 and 10th in 2014. Graham was also 31st in 2015, unranked in 2016 and 89th in 2017. Advertisement • The largest year-over-year drops have been by running backs: DeMarco Murray (No. 4 in 2015), Le’Veon Bell (No. 5 in 2018) and Jonathan Taylor (No. 5 in 2022) all fell from the top five to out of the next year\'s list, while Adrian Peterson slipped from No. 5 in 2016 to 98 in 2017. • Two kickers and zero punters have made the “Top 100.” Three fullbacks have combined to draw five selections.

            "In a moment captured live by NFL Films, Tyreek Hill's exuberant claim of being the best player in the NFL sparked significant backlash among fans and fellow athletes alike. During the 2024 'NFL Top 100' ceremony, Hill attempted to lift Raheem Mostert onto the trophy meant for him, declaring, 'I've been wanting this s— for so long!' His audacious act followed his earlier declaration from his rookie year with the Kansas City Chiefs, where he boldly stated he'd surpass Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback. Despite Hill achieving No. 1 in the subsequent year's ranking, many questioned his victory. Notably, Patrick Mahomes, another prominent figure in football, secured the fourth spot, while Lamar Jackson took second place. A FanDuel poll revealed that 85% of participants disagreed with Hill's placement. The 'NFL Top 100,' which began shortly after its inaugural episode post-2011 draft, continues to stir heated discussions every year.

            "The Las Vegas Raiders will play football next week. The Raiders will take the field for their first preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday, Aug. 7, at 7 PM PST. This is the first chance Raider Nation will have to see their new-look Silver and Black team. While the main starters will not see too much action, they will be on the field for a few series, so fans will see Geno Smith and Ashton Jeanty for a little while before they wrap up their evenings. The bulk of the preseason is for rookies and roster hopefuls to prove they belong. Which Raiders should fans keep an eye on? Let’s break down three Raiders who will excite fans this preseason. Wide receiver Dont’e Thornton Jr. The fourth-round rookie has been impressing coaches, teammates, and fans through the early days of training camp. Thornton has a rare blend of height, weight, and speed at 6-foot-5 and 205 pounds. He ran a 4.3 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine. Thornton came to the Raiders as a raw prospect, but appears to be much further along in his development. He should see many targets throughout the preseason, no matter who is at quarterback. Quarterback Cam Miller The North Dakota State product is one of the most prolific passers in school history, and considering the number of impressive quarterbacks to come from that program, that’s saying something. Miller set the Bison’s single-season completions and passing yards record in 2024. He sits alone atop the program’s passing yard leaderboard and is second all-time in passing touchdowns. Geno Smith will likely see a series or two, while Aidan O’Connell will take the bulk of the series. Miller will get a chance to show off his talents late in the game, and fans may be impressed. Wide receiver/quarterback Tommy Mellott The Raiders are going to use Mellott in all sorts of fun ways this preseason. Mellott, a former quarterback at Montana State, is switching to receiver in the NFL. That means he will be a gadget player who the team can use in the Wildcat offense. This should lead to fun plays in the preseason from the electric offensive weapon, and fans will fall in love with what he brings to the team. The preseason is about fun, and that’s what Mellott will bring.

This marks the inaugural opportunity for supporters to witness the revamped Silver and Black squad in action. Although star players such as Geno Smith and Ashton Jeanty won't dominate the field, they'll appear briefly, giving fans glimpses into their capabilities.\nThe spotlight shines brightly on several promising young athletes poised to captivate audiences. Wide receiver Dont'e Thornton Jr., selected in the fourth round, stands out due to his exceptional combination of stature—6-foot-5—and agility, highlighted by a 4.3-second 40-yard dash time at the NFL Scouting Combine. His progress since joining the Raiders suggests he'll receive numerous opportunities regardless of the quarterback situation.\nQuarterback Cam Miller emerges from North Dakota State's storied program, where he's already etched his name among its top passers. With records broken under his belt—including setting single-season completion and passing yardage benchmarks—the Raiders expect Miller to dazzle spectators later in the game after brief appearances alongside Geno Smith and Aidan O’Connell.\nTommy Mellott offers another intriguing dynamic as he transitions from quarterbacking duties at Montana State to playing as a wide receiver within the NFL framework. His adaptability could shine particularly when employed in innovative formations like the Wildcat offense, adding excitement to the Raiders' strategic gameplay.\nAs the preseason unfolds, these emerging talents promise to deliver thrilling performances that will undoubtedly endear them to fans and contribute significantly to the team's future success.",

            "As Boston College gears up for its 2025 football season, the Eagles' wide receiver corps stands poised for success thanks to a blend of experienced veterans and promising newcomers. At the forefront of the returning talent is Lewis Bond, whose impressive performance in 2024 earned him a team-leading 689 receiving yards. Bond, along with fellow redshirt senior Reed Harris—who amassed 486 yards and four touchdowns that season—and junior Jaeden Skeete, forms the backbone of the team's offensive strategy.\nThe addition of VJ Wilkins further bolsters the group's depth, ensuring versatility across different game situations. Notably, several key players from previous seasons remain integral parts of the unit; these include sophomore Johnathan Montague Jr., who transitioned from quarterbacking to catching after sustaining injuries early in the season, and other reliable receivers like Datrell Jones, Luke McLaughlin, and Ismael Zamor.\nFreshmen bring youthful energy and potential to the mix, with standout prospects such as Nedrick Boldin Jr., Semaj Fleming, and Dawson Pough joining the ranks. Boldin Jr., hailing from Florida and highly regarded by scouts, joins a talented ensemble that promises dynamic playmaking capabilities throughout the upcoming campaign.",
